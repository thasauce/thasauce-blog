<img border="0" align="right" src="http://h.xerol.org/i/m6hotel.jpg" />From [Brendan](http://magfest.org/forum_message.php?forum_id=2&thread_id=498):

_&#8220;That&#8217;s right, you can now reserve a hotel room for MAGFest 6! Rooms at the Hilton Mark Center are $99/night (+tax) for 1-4 people per room, one king or two double beds. We have the run of house arrangement, but that means first come first serve for whatever kind of room you want. Reserve early!</p> 

There isn&#8217;t an online link to reserve yet, so for now, just call the hotel and tell them you&#8217;ll be attending MAGFest. The number is 703-845-1010 (just hit 1 if you get an automated system). If you have any difficulties, let us know!&#8221;</em>
