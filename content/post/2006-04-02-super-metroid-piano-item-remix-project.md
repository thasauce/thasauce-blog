While only having five tracks at the moment, what makes this project most interesting is that it will remain open

&#8220;Unlike most of hte game projects I have seen, the projects here at vgpiano will not be sealed off after their inital release. The members of vgpiano will always be free to contribute additional tracks to any game project we have until the entire game is scored&#8221;

The tracks currently posted are great, so everyone download
