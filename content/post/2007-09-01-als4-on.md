From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgmix.com/vg25/viewtopic.php?id=7706">VGMix</a>:

_<img border="0" align="right" title="" alt="" src="http://h.xerol.org/i/als4-splash.png" />&#8220;Many of you know of it, and some of you have participated in it, and the latest incarnation is set to start in one day: **Auld Lang Sine** is the music &#8220;contest&#8221; I run, which has been on hiatus for a while but will be starting on September 1st. The concept isn&#8217;t so much a competition as it is to see who can write and produce an album within the allotted time.&#8221;_
  
_We&#8217;re starting a bit earlier than usual this year, simply because I&#8217;m anxious to get started, but there&#8217;s also one major change: **I will be able to host all entries this time!** My webhost has graciously expanded their plans to the extent that I don&#8217;t need to worry about webspace or bandwidth for quite a long time, so I&#8217;m now able to run the entire contest from my own site. ðŸ™‚</p> 

Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://als.ubikmusic.org">http://als.ubikmusic.org</a> for forthcoming details and the contest itself!</em>

Additionally, Ubik requested that all former participants provide updated links to their works from previous ALSes, since he&#8217;ll also be re-hosting these as well.
