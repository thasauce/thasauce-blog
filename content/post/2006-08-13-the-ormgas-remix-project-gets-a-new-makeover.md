In the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve been revamping <a href="http://ogr.tanatopia.net/" target="_blank">a new page</a> for the <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/forum_viewtopic.php?2.16317" target="_blank">OrmGas Remix Project</a>!

For those of you who don&#8217;t know what that is, it&#8217;s a project exclusive to <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/" target="_blank">Ormgas</a> members. They make the tracklist and the community has its own remixers to do stuff. We&#8217;re quite soft on that rule, so even prolific OC ReMixers get to join too.
  
The site&#8217;s main purpose is to let people upload and rate WIPs and whatnot autonomously. I&#8217;ll be shortly adding something for the tracklists too.

Do visit <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/" target="_blank">Ormgas</a> admin and my host <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/user.php?id.955" target="_blank">Tanaric</a>&#8216;s page. If you can, a spare dollar wouldn&#8217;t hurt to keep the darn expensive costs down.

P.S.: e107.
