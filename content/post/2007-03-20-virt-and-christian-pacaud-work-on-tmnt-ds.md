  The new TMNT DS game, aptly titled, &#8220;TMNT,&#8221; has been released this week. What makes this game so special, other than it being a Ninja Turtles game? Jake Kaufman and Christian Pacaud were involved! Yet another high profile game to add to Jake and Christian&#8217;s resumâˆšÂ©s.

  IGN sums up the videogame:</p> 
  
  <p>
    <em>&#8220;This Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is<br /> based on the CG animated movie produced by Imagi Animation Studios and based on Mirage Studios&#8217; Foot Clan-kicking Turtle heroes. The game takes place in a New York City plagued by secretive villains and<br /> strange, otherworldly creatures. Faced with these perils, the Turtles will experience their most trying time as heroes and as a family, as Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo lose their focus and struggle to<br /> maintain their unity and ninja discipline.&#8221;</em>

    Let me tell you now though, those people expecting classic TMNT rock will be disappointed. Virt writes:

    <em>&#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for nostalgic rocking out, you&#8217;ll be incredibly disappointed &#8211; this is a much darker game than the old ones, so I wasn&#8217;t allowed to unleash the Konami rock fury, it&#8217;s mostly orchestral/electronic underscore and beats, with guitar in only a few tracks (as a motif for a specific character) Decision from up high, nothing we could do.&#8221;</em>
