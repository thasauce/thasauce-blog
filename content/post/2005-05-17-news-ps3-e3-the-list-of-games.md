Via <a target="_self" href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=4957">GamesAreFun</a>:

During their press conference today, [Sony](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Company&search=Sony)
  
announced various new titles that will be appearing on the Playstation
  
3. Though details are a bit sketchy at this time, the ones we know of
  
for sure right now are&#8230;

[_Devil May Cry 4_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Devil%20May%20Cry%204)
  

  
[_Final Fantasy XIII_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Final%20Fantasy%20XIII)
  

  
[_Gran Turismo 5_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Gran%20Turismo%205)
  

  
[_Killzone 2_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Killzone%202)

unnamed game similar to [_God of War_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=God%20of%20War)

Little info is known about these games, but there will likely be
  
more to follow in the coming days. At the very least we should have a
  
trailer or screenshots of most of these games by the end of the week,
  
so stay tuned!

**Update**: It appears a new [_Grand Theft Auto_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Grand%20Theft%20Auto) has not been announced, though [Rockstar](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Company&search=Rockstar) did announce its plans to support the PS3.
