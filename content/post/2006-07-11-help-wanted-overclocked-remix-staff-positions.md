<span class="postbody">OverClocked ReMix is looking for individuals to fill three staff positions.</span>
  
<span class="postbody"><strong>Japanese Language Correspondent/Translator (2)</strong></p> 

<p>
  These two positions would be available to djpretzel, the judges panel,<br /> and other OCR staff or project coordinators for translating material to<br /> and from Japanese. Possible contexts would be contacting Japanese<br /> composers for questions/interviews, translating site materials into<br /> Japanese, translating submission emails made in Japanese, and<br /> performing site-related research using Japanese websites.
</p>

<p>
  We&#8217;re NOT looking for third or fourth-year Japanese students who<br /> have a basic proficiency with spoken Japanese and hiragana/katakana<br /> only. We&#8217;re looking for fluent readers & writers specifically, with<br /> a strong grasp of Kanji, who can visit text-heavy Japanese websites and<br /> without much effort know what&#8217;s being said. I don&#8217;t want to discourage<br /> people *too* much, but I know that a lot of OCR visitors are anime<br /> fans, like myself, who know at least a little &#8220;otaku&#8221; Japanese from<br /> watching Evangelion, etc., and I want to be clear that we&#8217;re looking<br /> for fluent readers and writers of the language. There may be some sort<br /> of test involved, depending on interest.
</p>

<p>
  Neither of these positions would require too much time/effort &#8211; it<br /> would be intermittent, from month to month, probably going weeks or<br /> months without any requests &#8211; but when a need does arise, we&#8217;d like a<br /> couple dedicated, fluent folk interested in helping OCR out to be<br /> available.
</p>

<p>
  If you think you could fill one of these positions, contact <strong>djpretzel@ocremix.org</strong>.

  <strong>T-Shirt Shipping Assistant (Southeast Michigan ONLY: Ann Arbor, Saline, Dexter, Ypsilanti, etc.)</strong>
</p>

<p>
  As some of you are (painfully) aware, we&#8217;ve been having problems<br /> shipping shirts out on time. Part of this is because Zachary Williams,<br /> who hosts OCR for free and runs the store from which the shirts are<br /> sold, simply doesn&#8217;t have the time and resources to actually do the<br /> shipping. He&#8217;s looking for an assistant in the Southeast Michigan area<br /> that&#8217;d be willing to help ship things out as orders come in. This would<br /> involve some traveling to his house and perhaps to the local shirt<br /> store where the shirts are printed, preferably on a weekly or bi-weekly<br /> basis.
</p>

<p>
  Zach&#8217;s got more details if there&#8217;s anyone in the area that can help<br /> us, and him, out. There&#8217;s a possibility of limited pay involved, but<br /> certainly there&#8217;d be a free shirt or two, and some other goodies that<br /> the ztnet store sells.
