Just a quick _Sound Bytes_ feature highlighting [Flexstyle](http://flexstylemusic.com/wp/)&#8216;s mix of [zircon](http://zirconmusic.com/)&#8216;s original track &#8220;Just Hold On&#8221;, featuring vocalist [Jillian Aversa](http://jillianaversa.com/):

> Anyone who&#8217;s used FL Studio in the past year or so should probably recognize this song. Made by producer, composer, and sound designer extraordinaire Andrew Aversa, aliasÂ <a href="http://soundcloud.com/zircon-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">zircon</a>, and featuring the gorgeous vocals of his wife Jillian, &#8220;Just Hold On&#8221; is the demo song in FL Studio 10. I decided to take it warp it into more of a hip-hop/trancey number. This is what I came up with&#8211;enjoy!
