The ROM hack sequel to Chrono Trigger, &#8220;Crimson Echoes,&#8221; has been released in demo form again. Three chapters of the game are now playable (versus the simple prologue
  
of the last game), featuring new areas, scenes, events, characters and
  
story as the rich world of Crimson Echoes unfolds.
  
Nearly every era is
  
accessible, and a host of other surprises await. I&#8217;m really reluctant
  
to reveal much more, as you must experience it for yourself. At a
  
minimum, the demo will last 30-40 minutes; at maximum, if you talk
  
to all the NPCs and immerse yourself in the world of the game, it can
  
last up to 3 hours or more. Instructions for playing are in the
