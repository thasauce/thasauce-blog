From <a href="http://www.vgdj.net/" target="_blank">vgdj.net</a>:

_VGDJ in video?! What has the
  
world come to? Contrary to popular belief, we&#8217;re not just a bunch of
  
disembodied voices floating around on the internet&#8230; but we wanted to
  
prove it with our first ever videocast._
  
_This is your chance to actually
  
SEE zircon, pixietricks, djpretzel, Liontamer, GeoffreyTaucer, and
  
friends in living color. Check out all our crazy footage from last
  
week&#8217;s OCR Otakon panel, and not without a few added bonuses, of
  
course! There are three versions available for download, for
  
those of you residing on the extremes of web speed:</p> 

[Low res](http://www.vgdj.net/Shows/VGDJ_ep_053_low.mov) (70 MB)  
[Medium Res](http://www.vgdj.net/Shows/VGDJ_ep_053.mov) (130 MB)  
[High res](http://www.vgdj.net/Shows/VGDJ_ep_053_high.mov) (400 MB)

Note:
  
If you wanna view this cast on your iPod, you&#8217;ll have to convert it to
  
mp4. We gave up on that long ago, for various reasons. But the MOV&#8217;s
  
should play in iTunes, at least. Have fun, kiddies!</em>
