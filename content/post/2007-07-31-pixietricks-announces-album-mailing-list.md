From [OCR](http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=11056):

_&#8220;Hey guys. I have a bit of exciting news to announce. First and foremost, my first original album is currently underway! That&#8217;s right &#8211; one album, one me, and&#8230; an indeterminate number of songs. ^_~ When will be the release, you ask? I&#8217;m shooting for this coming spring, 2008. A realistic goal, I believe, but I&#8217;ll hold off on the specifics until things are closer to completion.&#8221;_
  
_&#8220;Now, if you are a particularly zealous fan &#8211; or even a mildly curious person &#8211; then you&#8217;re in luck! I have finally set up an official mailing list, which will allow me to send out the occasional update with samples of my current work, release dates, and other tasty tidbits. If you&#8217;re at all interested, don&#8217;t hesitate to join! Just head over to the &#8220;Contact&#8221; page on my website, enter in your email address, and check off the &#8220;Join my Mailing List&#8221; option before submitting.&#8221;_
