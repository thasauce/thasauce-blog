  Our story starts with &#8220;Cleveland Rock,&#8221; a remixer-hopeful submitting a Mario&#8217;s Time Machine ReMix in &#8220;surf rock&#8221; style. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=5311">This is the result</a>.

  As you can see, it received a NO OVERRIDE from Judge Larry Oji because<br /> it was too close to the original.
