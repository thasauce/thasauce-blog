After a long month of grueling work by ZeaLitY and others, a patch for KWhazit&rsquo;s Chrono Compendium <a href="http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Retranslation.html" target="_blank">Chrono Trigger Retranslation</a> is out. In addition to inserting the entire script, the hack uses a fix to mimic Ayla&rsquo;s nickname for Crono, adds in Sky / Dark elemental icons to replace Lightning / Shadow, and restores the Japanese ending art for the Marle searching for Crono with the Epoch ending. The only external changes are a pre-title screen and changes in the ASCII credits; there are no easter eggs. The linked page also connects to a &ldquo;making-of / how-to&rdquo; feature and a pack of three patches allowing users to implement the changes described above on personal projects. So, surprise! And have fun.
