title: Anime Remix FMA Project Needs Remixers
topic:

<u>**The Lowdown**</u>:
  
Anime Remix ( www.animeremix.org ) be havin&#8217; a remixin&#8217; project, and
  
the anime is Full Metal Alchemist. FMA has a kinda big soundtrack
  
(upwards of 60 tracks), although a sizeable number of them are mere
  
re-arrangements of others. (ex: Commandment vs. Deep Forst vs. Dante)
  
Additinally, AR has a smaller population than, say, OC ReMix, so we&#8217;ve
  
decided to remix 15 choice tracks from the project, chosen primarily
  
for their recognition factor, and organized (very) roughly in order of
  
appearance. 
  
<u>**</u>For up-to-date news about the project, to participate, or to learn more, go to the thread on the AR forums: <a href="http://www.animeremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=589" target="_self"><br /> http://www.animeremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=589</a>

Mixers can do as many songs as they want, if there are free tracks, and
  
ideally mixers will work with the other mixers whose songs come
  
immediately before or after them, mixing in elements of each others&#8217;
  
songs, or otherwise making the transition between tracks smooth.
  
Collaborations are perfectly fine, but there will be no song medleys in
  
the remix project.

Pick the genre you want to mix, though as of this writing the project
  
is leaning fairly heavily towards trance. The title of your mix should
  
contain some sort of &#8220;metal&#8221; word &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have to be a
  
&#8220;scientific&#8221; metal, just something that an average person would think
  
of as metal. Here&#8217;s a list of a few metals, for your convenience:

Aluminum, Bronze, Chrome, Cobalt, Copper, Gold, \*Iron, Lead, Nickel, Pewter, Platinum, Silver, Steel, Tin, \*Titanium, Zinc.

* denotes a metal that has been taken. There are 15 tracks, so the last
  
few names might be stretching things a bit. If we have to, we can
  
re-use metal words, though it&#8217;d be cooler if we didn&#8217;t.

<u>**The Tracklist**</u>:

These have been chosen for the &#8220;recognition factor&#8221; &#8212; that is, anyone
  
who&#8217;s seen the anime should be able to recognize most, if not all of
  
them. They are now in official order! (Note: All remixes here are works in progress only at this point.)

&#8212;-

So, what next? Well, here&#8217;s the plan, as I have it now:

1. Remixers who have not yet made a WIP, or have not yet claimed a song, pick one &#8212; **you can still participate**.

2. Remixers who have already made a WIP &#8212; you have two choices. One:
  
you can finish a draft version of your WIP (approximately the length of
  
your final project, but it need not be perfect, mastered, the right
  
samples, humanized, what-have-you &#8212; this is like the rough draft of a
  
paper; get down all the ideas you want so you can clean it up later. We
  
can go over these and decide what needs work and what&#8217;s fine as soon as
  
you&#8217;ve got something down. Option Two: Pick another song and make a WIP
  
of it also. Pick more if you feel really industrious. If we get more
  
than one WIP for a chosen song, we can take a vote on which one is
  
better, once drafts are done. Or the remixers can work together in a
  
collab. We can decide about that if/when it happens.

3. We could use some album art, eventually. This is a little early,
  
since we haven&#8217;t even decided on a final title for the project, but if
  
any you graphic designers around here is feeling industrious but bored,
  
you can see what you can cook up for a Full Metal AlcheMIX or whatever
  
we decide on. Transmutation circles, Ed & Al, headphones &#8212;
  
whatever you decide to throw in there is fine; just make something
  
that&#8217;ll look cool in a CD case for the project. No deadline on this yet.

&#8212;

<u>**Deadlines**</u>

Okay, we need people to take this project seriously. So here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got in terms of deadlines:

1. **I want 1-minute WIPs of every song in the project by June
  
30th.** I don&#8217;t care how this has to happen &#8212; if one remixer does
  
ten tracks, so be it. But we need to get _something_ down.

2. **I want drafts of at least one song from eachparticipating remixer by August
  
31st.** This way during September and October we can really get into
  
the finalizing/polishing stage, with the project ending maybe before
  
Thanksgiving of next year.

These dates are subject to change depending on my personal schedule and
  
Mythril&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;ll be moving into my dorm on August 21st, so we&#8217;ll see
  
how that ends up.

Remember, this project is organized from the anime remix forums, so go there if you&#8217;re interested:
