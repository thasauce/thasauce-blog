OverCoat, aka Scott Porter, is a busy man. Not only is he the host of two radio shows over on <a title="Arecibo Radio" href="http://www.areciboradio.com" target="_blank">Arecibo Radio</a>Â (Touhou Tuesday and his own Radio Overcoat), but he also makes music! The third entry in his self-titled series of EPs dropped on August 14, titled OverCoat 3: One Night in Neo-Seattle. Encompassing five tracks for a runtime of 16:34, this EP takes the listener on a cyberpunk adventure through a futuristic variation on Seattle. And, just as the album takes you on a tour through the city, what follows takes you on a tour through the album! You can follow along by grabbing the album <a title="OverCoat 3: One Night in Neo-Seattle" href="http://overcoat.bandcamp.com/album/overcoat-3-one-night-in-neo-seattle" target="_blank">here</a>, or you can snag it later! Whichever route you take, it&#8217;s time to go!

&#8212;

1. Sunset 2:12
  
The first song starts out simply, setting the stage and the mood. At 0:21 the soundscape begins to fill out, and even more at 0:41 or so. The main rhythm at 1:21 or so is pretty nice, and really finishes making that soundscape full. I already feel like I&#8217;m on a journey of sorts. It all drops at around the two minute mark.
  
2. International District 4:00
  
This track starts off right away, with some percussives at about the 0:22 mark. Some melody comes in at 0:33 or so, adding to the feel of the song. There&#8217;s a slight breakdown at about 1:04, and it gives way at 1:14 for some cool effects. 1:36 mixes it up a bit, bringing some nice string plucking of sorts. 2:03 drops out all the extra stuff, only to return the main melody at 2:13 or so. 2:39 brings a simpler feel, one that also is clearly a herald to what will be the end of the song. Climactic parts are always fun! Now I&#8217;m getting a Deku Tree vibe from the part at 3:04 or so, as in the music that plays when he&#8217;s talking. Main melody back at 3:28, and the end begins at 3:52.
  
3. The Market 3:13
  
SYNTH! Apparently that&#8217;s what this market deals in, synths. 0:18 brings in the beat and 0:38 brings in a melody. There&#8217;s some release set to these instruments, and it sounds good. I suddenly want to play a game where this is the shopping theme. A nice change-up at about the 1:23 mark comes in, and it works well. 1:44 brings that melody back. Breakdown at 2:09 or so, and it&#8217;s this track&#8217;s climax. Main melody returns at 2:28 or so, and the fadeout begins at 3:07.
  
4. Broadway 3:57
  
Ooh I like the instrument choice on this one. Beat comes in at 0:16, and rhythm at 0:22 or so. I really enjoy the backing rhythm; it works well and keeps the momentum intact. 0:54 or so has a nice changeup, only to mix it up even more at 1:10 or so. It keeps going this way until 1:49 when the main melody returns to prominence. 2:39 brings a return to how it was at the start, truly heralding the end of the mix-up. 3:13 drops out one of the lead instruments, and leads to the fadeout at 3:47.
  
5. Phantom Bracelet 3:12
  
Ah yes, this track. Cool intro, which picks up at 0:13 or so with the first beat and some wub sounds at 0:27. Melody comes in at about 0:51, adding to the fullness of the track. This continues until 1:42, when the wubs drop out. There&#8217;s an obvious feel of a buildup, and the wubs return at 2:07. The melody vanishes at this point, and another sound vanishes at 2:35 or so. The wubs continue until 2:59, until replaced by the finale.
