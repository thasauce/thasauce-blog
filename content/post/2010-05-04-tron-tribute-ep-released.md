  A new EP has just been released by the great <a rel="nofollow" href="http://8bitweapon.com/">8<br /> Bit Weapon</a> (and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.computeher.net/bio.htm">ComputeHer</a>,<br /> of course) featuring 5 tracks all in homage of the classic 1982 science<br /> fiction film &ldquo;Tron&rdquo;. You get to hear Wendy Carlos&rsquo;s scores redone in a<br /> 8bit remix version that still carrys the intense, nostalgic, climatic<br /> feeling. ï¿½The 5 tracks feature three different mixes called Tron Scherzo<br /> and two mixes of the Theme + Ending. ï¿½Each mix are named after the<br /> characters from the movie. ï¿½My personal favorites go out to Sark&rsquo;s<br /> Revenge Mix and Flynn&rsquo;s Fare.
