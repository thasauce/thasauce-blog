JMP Productions announced today that Nintendo&#8217;s famous video game
  
composer Koji Kondo is going to attend the world-premiere of PLAY! A
  
Video Game Symphony on May 27, 2006, in Chicago at the Rosemont
  
Theatre. His attendance includes some exciting surprises for his fans
  
to be revealed at a later time. Nobuo Uematsu&#8217;s music from Blue Dragon will be performed exclusively for the
  
first time at PLAY!&#8217;s premiere in Chicago on **Saturday, May 27, 2006**. The
  
video game is designed by Final Fantasy series originator Hironobu Sakaguchi.
  
The presentation of Blue Dragon at the concert will include never seen before
  
visuals from the highly-anticipated Xbox 360 title. PLAY! A Video Game Symphony
  
is a symphony concert world-tour featuring music from a catalogue of blockbuster
  
video game titles. 

Koji Kondo is one of the most highly-acclaimed video game music
  
composers in the world. His songs are certainly memorable; the SUPER
  
MARIO BROS. theme song is still a mainstream icon 20 years after it was
  
written and about as recognized as a 1980&#8217;s pop song. Kondo&rsquo;s music has
  
been cited as being as integral to the Nintendo style as the game
  
design of Shigeru Miyamoto.

Blue Dragon is an RPG developed by veterans of the video game industry, bringing
  
together Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi with Dragon Ball creator Akira
  
Toriyama providing character designs, and Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu
  
contributing the soundtrack. 

Says Jason Michael Paul: &#8220;We are pulling
  
out all the stops for this once in a lifetime event at the PLAY! premiere. Come
  
be a part of what promises to be a show of many firsts in the US and worldwide
  
for that matter. I am just truly grateful to have the opportunity to give a
  
sneak peek to one of the most anticipated video games that the world has ever
  
seen. The inclusion of Blue Dragon into the program only further legitimizes
  
this concert as being the marquee event of the year.&#8221;. 

All tickets for
  
the world-premiere of PLAY! including the VIP meet and greet are available at
  
the box office, Ticketmaster locations, on the
