Last week, Crimson announced that he had begun <a href="http://dwellingofduels.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80:dod-shirts-preorder&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">accepting pre-orders for DoD shirts</a>. Now today, on their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dwelling-of-Duels/160975350590652" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all new Facebook fan page</a> DoD announced that the first wave of shirts had been paid for, and should begin printing soon.

The shirts are available in sizes small to XXXL and are $14 for US citizens, and $17 for international orders.

Will YOU be one of the first to rock an epic Alucard shreddage shirt? I know I will be.
