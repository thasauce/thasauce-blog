<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mlgpro.com/">Major League Gaming</a> and the television network <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usanetwork.com/">USA</a>
  
have inked a deal allowing USA to air 7 one hour episodes this fall,
  
featuring MLG&#8217;s professional circuit and its players, as well as
  
play-by-play commentary that one would normally associate with live
  
sports.
  
&#8220;This is the sign that pro
  
gaming has finally arrived to the mass market,&#8221; said Matthew Bromberg,
  
MLG&#8217;s president and chief operating officer. &#8220;It&#8217;s like poker was two
  
years ago, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nascar.com/">NASCAR</a> 15 years ago.&#8221;

This is the first time professional video gaming is getting a spotlight
  
on a medium which will be broadcast into the homes of millions, instead
  
of simply being available through the internet. While there have
  
been a few spotlights on games on various newscasts/children&#8217;s
  
networks, there wasn&#8217;t much of an acceptance for gaming as anything
  
more than sheer entertainment.

While I&#8217;m skeptical, especially as this seems to be a ploy to lure in
  
more corporate sponsership, this could be a good thing for
  
gaming. It may show the mass of American people that gaming is
  
more than just entertainment, that it is a viable career option in some
  
circles, as the X-Games did for pro-BMXing and skateboarding before.
