IndieBox is a new subscription service that allows gamers to discover a new game each month &#8212; all while supporting independent game creators.

Every month, IndieBox will deliver a new game, right to your mailbox. Your IndieBox will feature retro-style custom packaging and will be filled with goodies &#8212; including a unique cartridge and case with your game, a full color manual, and other fun extras such as posters, stickers, and soundtrack CDs.

And, the best part is, IndieBox games are all developed by independent creators. Your IndieBox subscription is not only a fun way to discover great new games, but it is also a great way to support talented game creators. Working with independent creators also allows IndieBox to closely monitor the quality of the games released, so you can enjoy the best indie games around. All IndieBox games are also completely DRM free, and fully compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux systems.
