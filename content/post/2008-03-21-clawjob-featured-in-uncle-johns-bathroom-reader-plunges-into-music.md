You may remember <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/clawjob-launches-the-society-of-clawjob-aficionados-offers-free-swag/" target="_blank">a post Larry made</a> awhile back about how rok and rawk of <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/projectx/" target="_blank">Project X</a> live on and have started a new band, <a href="http://www.clawjob.com/" target="_blank">Clawjob</a>. Well I picked this up in a <a href="http://bulletins.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bulletin.read&messageID=5556439527&MyToken=cbecae47-0095-4055-a59a-9a5fa4d01924" target="_blank">MySpace bulletin</a> earlier today:

    In yet another in a series of honors, Clawjob has had its legacy cemented by the world&#8217;s foremost lexicon of rock lore, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Johns-Bathroom-Reader-Plunges/dp/1592238246/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206061963&sr=8-1"><em>Uncle John&#8217;s Bathroom Reader Plunges into Music</em></a>!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The wise editors of this venerated tome have included Clawjob&#8217;s science fiction rock opera <em><a href="http://clawjob.com/store/music.htm#spacecrackers">Space Crackers</a></em> in a short list of greatest flop concept albums in history!

  </div>
  
  <p>
    In a bold, forward-thinking move, these great compilers of rock legend have taken it upon themselves to alter the plot of <em>Space Crackers</em> in their synopsis, so as to preserve the album&#8217;s mystery for the sad few who have not yet heard it.
