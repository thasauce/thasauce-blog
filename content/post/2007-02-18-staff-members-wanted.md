Sakari has a need for more **staff members**. However the staff members we need right now are not musicians, but from other areas.

Check out this link for more information:  
<a href="http://www.sakari-infinity.net/opportunities" target="_blank">http://www.sakari-infinity.net/opportunities</a>
  
What I&#8217;m really, really looking for right now is a **Site Coordinator**.
  
Someone who can be in charge of site content, official emails and
  
newsletters, some event coordination, and redirecting hate mail to our
  
good friends at Microsoft. (Note: We don&#8217;t get hate mail)

I&#8217;m
  
looking to turn this site into something nicer than what it is, and as
  
hard as we try, we staff members are only musicians with naught the
  
skill set needed for this position. It&#8217;d be a real perk for this person
  
to live in Maryland, but it&#8217;s definitely not required in the least.

This position comes with the following:

  * Full access to the Staff forums
  * An email account
  * Access to parts of the Admin site
  * Other items to be discussed upon decision



* * *The other position, 

**Asst. Web Developer**,
  
is an experimental position. I&#8217;d like to test it out to see how it
  
works, but I foresee an interesting outcome. The catch? This person has
  
to be able to keep up with _me_, thus the high-set requirements for the position.</p> 

It&#8217;d
  
be best if this person were in a similar geographic location as me, but
  
not required &#8211; though it will be tough to convince me if I can&#8217;t meet
  
with you face-to-face.

This position comes with the following:

  * Full access to the Staff forums
  * An email account
  * Full access to parts of the Admin site
  * FTP Access to the site
  * Other items to be discussed upon decision



* * *If you know someone or are interested, please let me or another staff member know.
