San Francisco composer [Disasterpeace](http://www.disasterpeace.com), also known as [Rich Vreeland](http://www.richvreeland.com), really knows how to spend his time creating something absolutely delightful. And by &#8216;time&#8217;, we mean every progressive second that we have listened to with his most recent work like _[Rise of the Obsidian Interstellar](http://disasterpeace.com/album/rise-of-the-obsidian-interstellar)__Â _wholeheartedly changes up the conventions of chip music, giving room for something reminiscent between progressive rock and 8-bit ambience, Â along with a fewÂ intriguingÂ twists in style.

Along with the exciting release of the multiple award-winning indie platformerÂ [FEZ](http://polytroncorporation.com/) just this week alone, Disasterpeace&#8217;s original soundtrack of the same name is also scheduled to be available this Friday, April 20th. From what we&#8217;ve heard of the available free tracks, theÂ _FEZ_ soundtrack isÂ astonishingly awe-inspiring. &#8220;Home&#8221; sets an interesting, lo-fi quality that seems to be explored throughout select songs while Â &#8220;Puzzle&#8221; reveals a evocative change of pace and marks Disasterpeace&#8217;s ability to easily transcend a set style in favor of establishing mood and tone throughout the Â actual game itself. Â &#8220;Compass&#8221; is another favorite of ours that is simply stimulating and beautiful, which we feel speaks loudly (or rather, softly) about Disasterpeace&#8217;s power to create contemplative spaciousness.

You can pre-order your copy now of the original_Â FEZ_ soundtrack on Disasterpeace&#8217;s [Bandcamp](http://disasterpeace.com/album/fez), available for $5.
