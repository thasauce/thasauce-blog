</center>Along with his illustrious credentials as 

_the_ monumentalÂ guitaristÂ inÂ not [one](http://www.armcannon.com/), but [two](http://www.metroidmetal.com/), of the most popular bands in VGM history,Â Daniel Behrens has made quite a name for himself. This reputation may be punctuated by the fact that Behrens&#8217; solo work asÂ [Danimal Cannon](http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/),Â withÂ his latest albumÂ _[Roots](http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/album/roots),Â _has takenÂ the VGM community by storm. This may prove one of two things:Â Danimal Cannon is incredibly talented artist orÂ Danimal CannonÂ is actually a Norse god sent down by the heavens to teach us the ways of both epic shredding **andÂ **chiptunes indelibly made into a staunchÂ configurationÂ of a human being. While I would agree with the former, Danimal Cannon&#8217;s &#8220;Roots (IRL Mix)&#8221; may have most acquiesce to the latter. &#8220;Roots (IRL Mix)&#8221; takes orchestral metal to the next level, proving that Daniel Behrens is indeed a metal Thor incarnate.

Peep his latest song above and let us know what you think.Â While you can cop _Roots_ for a mere ten dollars, Danimal Cannon&#8217;s &#8220;Roots (IRL Mix)&#8221; is [available for free](http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/track/roots-irl-mix) on Bandcamp.
