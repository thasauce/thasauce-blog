Rockstar games, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, has announced today that a new game, _Bully_,
  
will be coming to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox this October. This is the
  
first game being developed by Rockstar Vancouver and follows the story
  
of a troublesome schoolboy in reform school as he tries to stand up to
  
bullies, gets picked on by teachers, plays pranks, and even tries to
  
get the girl. All of this takes place in the fictional Bullworth
  
Academy.
  
&#8220;We are really excited about the first title to be developed by our
  
Rockstar Vancouver studio,&#8221; said Sam Houser, President of Rockstar
  
Games. &#8220;We fought hard to keep this title under wraps for ages and I am
  
thrilled that we can finally unveil it to people at E3.&#8221;

_Bully_ will hopefully maintain Rockstar&#8217;s standard of making
  
games that are humorous, over-the-top, and push an envelope or few. But
  
more than just gamers will be looking forward to this one. Infamous
  
attorney Jack Thompson managed to find out about _Bully_ a couple
  
months ago and has already made attempts to contact the Department of
  
Education about the title. And if Jack Thompson is interested, then
  
that means that the game already has something going for it.

Be sure to check back for more information about _Bully_ during E3.
