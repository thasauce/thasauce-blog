excerpt: Following his wonderful debut album <i>BLUENOISE</i>, we're pleased to announce
  that PROTOÂ·DOME's latest head-bobbin' tracks are as catchy as ever. Creatively
  dubbed as 'chiptune jazz micro-music', BLUESCREEN gracefully borders the line of
  classy overtures and bold, saxxy tunes.

UK-based jazz artist [PROTOÂ·DOME](https://www.facebook.com/PROTODOME) Â has [recently released](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=38193) his second album, _BLUESCREEN_:

> From the creator of the hit chiptune album BLUENOISE, comes the exciting all-caps sequel, BLUESCREEN! This time around things get more varied with a touch less wah synth, a little more crazy hi-hat jamming and 100% more live sax on 1/10th of the tracks! Statistics! You know itâ€™s going to be good.

Following his wonderful debut album _[BLUENOISE](http://protodome.bandcamp.com/album/bluenoise)_, we&#8217;re pleased to announce thatÂ PROTOÂ·DOME&#8217;s latest head-bobbin&#8217; tracks are as catchy as ever. Creatively dubbed as &#8216;chiptune jazz micro-music&#8217;,Â _BLUESCREEN_ gracefully borders the line of classy overtures and bold, saxxy tunes.

BLUESCREEN is available now on [Bandcamp](http://protodome.bandcamp.com/album/bluescreen) and [Ubiktune](http://ubiktune.org/releases/ubi034-protodome-bluescreen).Â We&#8217;ve taken the liberty to embed a few of our favorite songs below for your listening pleasure.
