  PRC:A X has a special theme: instead of picking a single song, it&#8217;s Open (Theme) Season, which means that you can pick any opening (OP) theme you want (American and all foreign cartoons count too, remember!) and remix it for the competition! So, if you&#8217;re hankering to remix Tank!, the Simpsons theme, Cruel Angel&#8217;s Thesis, READY STEADY GO, or any other more obscure opening theme, now&#8217;s the time to do it!</em> </span><br /> <em>If you don&#8217;t have any ideas, you can always remix the </em><a href="http://mduo13.no-ip.org/fmaproject/Full_Metal_Alchemist_-_Melissa.mp3" target="_blank"><em>first Full Metal Alchemist OP</em></a><em> and submit it to the </em><a href="http://www.animeremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=589&#038;start=0" target="_blank"><em>FMA Project</em></a><em> while you&#8217;re at it. </p>

      Remixes will be due by Sunday, March 26th, at 11:59pm PST. That should give you plenty of time, so I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing some great remixes.
