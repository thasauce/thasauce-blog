Since 2000, [Minibosses](http://www.minibosses.com/) has been making huge headway within the VGM scene for their innovative covers, dynamic instrumentation, and an overall awesome presence when performing on-stage. While many would consider these guys a progressive rock band, the Minibosses have continuously pushed the limits of video game music covers (with [an award to show](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/bestof/2006/award/best-cover-band-197035/) for it!). Today&#8217;s _Quick Look_ features the Minibosses performing their fantastic interpretation of &#8220;Double Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Dr. Mario&#8221; at this year&#8217;s MAGFest X. If you&#8217;re feeling naughty, you can [download this video](http://www.kngi.org/opencircuit/magfest10/3dsvideo/HNI_0071.avi)Â and watch it in 3D for the cool effects. If not, well&#8230; this video is great all the same. Â Peep more of the Minibosses&#8217; eclectic sounds on [Bandcamp](http://minibosses.bandcamp.com/).
