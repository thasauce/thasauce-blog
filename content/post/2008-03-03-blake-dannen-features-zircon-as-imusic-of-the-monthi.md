  If you&rsquo;re in the eastern Pennsylvania area, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ve already heard of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/blakedannen">Blake Dannen</a><br /> &#8211; or more precisely, you&rsquo;ve probably heard his voice. A radio<br /> personality in the Lehigh Valley area for over a decade, Blake<br /> currently resides on 99.9FM &ldquo;The Hawk&rdquo;, a classic hits station (check<br /> out <a href="http://www.999thehawk.com/page.php?jock_id=2508&#038;page_id=9394">his host page here</a>) at 2-7PM, as well as 93.3FM (WMMR) in Philadelphia.

  I first met Blake (online, that is) via MySpace, where I saw he was<br /> a fan of BT and The Crystal Method, two of my own favorite artists, as<br /> well as a myriad of other bands from Led Zeppelin to The Clash. On <a href="http://www.myspace.com/blakedannen">his MySpace page</a>,<br /> he has a blog with a monthly feature called &ldquo;Music of the Month&rdquo; where<br /> he features and interviews musicians from a wide range of genres. I was<br /> honored to hear that he wanted to have me as the featured artist for<br /> March!</p> 
  
  <p>
    So, the interview is now up: just <a href="http://www.myspace.com/blakedannen">click here</a><br /> to get to Blake&rsquo;s page, and then go to the blog. It&rsquo;s pretty in-depth &#8211;</div>

      if you&rsquo;re curious about how I ended up producing music and remixing, I<br /> think you&rsquo;ll find it interesting! You can also read entries for<br /> previous months as well as lots of other great content. You&rsquo;ll notice<br /> &ldquo;Mindbender&rdquo; is his profile song, too&hellip; this guy is a class act <img border="0" class="wp-smiley" alt=":)" src="http://www.zirconstudios.com/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> So, definitely check out his page, tune into &ldquo;The Hawk&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re in the area, and show your support for a great DJ!
