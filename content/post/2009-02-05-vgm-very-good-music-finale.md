[VGM: Very Good Music](http://128.175.29.66:8000/listen.pls),
  
my weekly video game music radio show, airs Friday night at 10PM EST. This
  
week&#8217;s show is the **final show** of VGM, so don&#8217;t miss it. Cohosts are sure to be present in some form or another,
  
so tune in to find out who&#8217;s harassing me this week. Make sure to join [#vgm on EnterTheGame](irc://irc.enterthegame.com/vgm) to chat with other listeners too.
  
VGM:
  
Very Good Music features video game remixes, tracks from game OSTs, and
  
even original
  
non-vg tracks from composers and remixers. Whether it&#8217;s showcasing new
  
releases, dusting off the oldies (HA!), or playing popular requests,
  
you&#8217;re sure to get tracks from a variety of websites, games, remixers,
  
and genres. Come hang out with me this
  
and every Friday night with VGM: Very Good Music!
