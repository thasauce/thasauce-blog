  Shut up. I know, OMG VIRT music LOL! Whatever, the game has awesome music and it&#8217;s Contra, simple as that. </p> 
  
  <p>
    So<br /> yeah, I REALLY like this soundtrack, it&#8217;s one of the best I&#8217;ve ever<br /> heard and I think it deserves to be ruined by an overambitious project<br /> that&#8217;ll span every corner of the &#8220;remixing&#8221;/&#8221;arranging&#8221; scene.

<div class="quoted-text">
  This will be open to anyone and everyone. Here are a few rules and guidelines for everyone to keep in mind:</p> 
  
  <p>
    1.<br /> All songs are to be approved by me and a few others who I will choose<br /> to &#8220;judge&#8221;. If you worked on a song for 2 months and it still sucks,<br /> too bad.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. All songs are to be arranged in a &#8220;conservative&#8221;<br /> manner. Meaning, I don&#8217;t want you to take a fast, aggressive song and<br /> turn it into ambient bullshit. The music has lots of intricate details<br /> and layers to work with, you can arrange it without taking it to places<br /> it shouldn&#8217;t go. Also, I have to approve your idea before you can be<br /> considered for the project, and everyone is required to send me a 1<br /> minute demo before I can lock them in to work on the song they chose.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3.<br /> COLLABORATE! This music is really difficult to learn/play/arrange. I<br /> encourage everyone to hook up in teams and really get to know the song<br /> they&#8217;re doing and each members strengths.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. What 3 said, the<br /> most important thing here is making sure the music is KING. So yeah,<br /> you will need to have spot on performances (if doing something with<br /> live recordings), and good sounds. If you write a great arrangement but<br /> your sounds are sub-par, consider letting someone take your work and<br /> put it through their setup. I will do this for anyone who wants it, and<br /> I don&#8217;t want any credit, all I want is for the music to sound its best.<br /> If you can do a really awesome straight cover and just add a solo,<br /> that&#8217;s great (and most likely all I&#8217;ll be doing!&#8230; trust me, learning<br /> some of these songs is a project within itself)!!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This will not be OCR, VGMix or DoD exclusive, I have no idea how we&#8217;ll release yet. It&#8217;s a free for all at this point.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now,<br /> I know I&#8217;m talking like a dick, but I&#8217;ve had enough experience with<br /> these things to know exactly what I want from the music and from my<br /> team. This project is gonna have a &#8220;band&#8221; or &#8220;team&#8221; mentality. Everyone<br /> can give input, help out on other tracks, or whatever, as long as it<br /> sounds good. All that matters is the end result. I am recruiting people<br /> as we speak, and this is gonna be cross posted to OCR, the Shizz and<br /> anyplace else where I can get some quality musicians. This has to be<br /> done quickly because the game is as popular as it&#8217;s gonna get and I<br /> wanna strike while the mac-n-cheese is hot!

    As for the rest of the songs, they&#8217;re short event type tracks and they need to be incorporated into a few of the songs.
