For those that ever had a basic inquiry about OverClocked ReMix&#8217;s beloved/hated judges panel, your questions may just be answered.
  
Major revisions were completed this past Friday to the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/info/" target="_blank">OCR knowledge base</a>&#8216;s Judges Panel article, adapted from years of encoutering various questions and misconceptions about the panel and its procedures.

To learn more about the ins and outs of the judges panel, including criteria for choosing judges and how many submissions are accepted to OC ReMix, visit <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Judges_Panel" target="_blank">Judges Panel</a> at the OCR Wiki knowledge base.
