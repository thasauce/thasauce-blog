  Most people know by now that I&#8217;ve been a resident of Florida all my life, and that I moved to Orlando a few years ago to attend <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/" target="_blank">Full Sail University</a>&#8216;s Computer Animation Bachelors of Science Degree problem. Since I didn&#8217;t have a car I lived pretty close to campus, and I got pretty familiar with the surrounding area in the <a href="http://www.acomicshop.com/" target="_blank">Comic Shop</a> down the street. It was through this comic shop that I got to meet one of my favorite musicians, as well as learned about <a href="www.nerdapaloozafest.com" target="_blank">Nerdapalooza</a> where <a href="http://www.myspace.com/myf1" target="_blank">myf</a> (aka <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/artist/4666/mythril-nazgul" target="_blank">Mythril Nazgul</a>) would be performing just a few days later.

  I planned to walk the 8 miles it&#8217;d take to get there if I couldn&#8217;t find a ride, and luckily I did find a ride, because 8 miles is a lot longer than it seems on MapQuest. When I got there I was greeted by myf himself, along with <a href="http://thegrammarclub.com/" target="_blank">DJ Snyder of the Grammar Club</a>, who happened to be sitting with <a href="http://frontalot.com/" target="_blank">MC Frontalot</a> and <a href="http://schafferthedarklord.com/" target="_blank">Schaffer the Darklord</a>. Kind of intense stuff, really. Until then I&#8217;d only heard/seen MC Frontalot through <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/" target="_self">Penny Arcade</a> and G4, but now he&#8217;s sitting in front of me. Inside I saw ytcracker going through songs on his laptop and I met artists like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/random215" target="_self">Random</a> and <a href="http://zealous1.com/" target="_blank">Zealous1</a> and was completely blown away. I had no idea that Orlando was so rich with nerd culture (though I suppose I should) and I was told by quite a few people that it was getting bigger every day.

  Well now Nerdapalooza 2009 is coming up, and it&#8217;s bigger than ever. So big that mc chris has already been confirmed as a guest, as well as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/beefynerdcore" target="_self">Beefy</a> and <a href="http://shaelriley.com" target="_blank">Shael Riley</a> of the Grammar Club in their first ever live performance. <a href="http://twitter.com/suzums" target="_blank">Suzu</a> and <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/artist/4291/injury" target="_blank">starla</a> are making serious attempts to come join the awesome, rumor has it <a href="http://planetskill.com" target="_blank">AE</a> might be making an appearance, and I&#8217;ve recently heard via twitter that OCR may be cooking something up as well. You can bet ThaSauce&#8217;ll be out in full force, but what about you?

  Nerdapalooza is the closest thing to a summer MAGFest we have going right now. A mid-year nerd gathering with more music than you can handle.
