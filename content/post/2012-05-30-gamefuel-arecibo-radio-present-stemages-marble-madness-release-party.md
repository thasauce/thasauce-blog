Join [Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/) Â for a [GameFuel](http://kngi.org/about/infofaq-gamefuel) special presentation with [Grant &#8220;Stemage&#8221; Henry](http://stemage.com/) for the &#8220;Where Good Marbles Go To Die&#8221; release party_._Â Grant &#8220;Stemage&#8221; Henry, _the_ manÂ behind several amazing bands such as [Metroid Metal](http://www.metroidmetal.com/)Â and [Yes, Mayhem](http://yesmayhem.com/), is also an accomplished solo artist who has composed forÂ indie games _Alpha Squad_ and _Radiant Escape._ 

___[Marble Madness](http://stemage.bandcamp.com/)_ highlights seven new tracks featuring various accomplished guests such as [Disasterpeace](T&A with a Side of QQ), [Kirby Pufocia](http://kirbypufocia.bandcamp.com/),Â andÂ [VikingGuitar](http://www.vikingguitar.com/).Â Â Stemage emphasizes the direction of _Marble Madness_ when he states, &#8220;The Marble Madness soundtrack has a lot of variety, and that theme carries over to this album. Iâ€™ve actually been calling it a â€œcollection of remixesâ€ instead of an album, but things are really starting to flow together.&#8221;

Taking place on**Â June 2nd at 9 PM EST**, _Marble MadnessÂ _will be played in full, along with many other surprises, such as the digital release of the album during the show itself. And if you haven&#8217;t tuned intoÂ GameFuel, Â you&#8217;re in for a treat. GameFuel is a game-centric show of hard-hitting music, particularly of the videogame and videogame-inspired variety, also featuring chiptunes and other original works every week, hosted by the ever exuberant KyleJCrb.Â Be sure to tune in to [Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/)Â this Saturday for an exclusive listen to what may very well be an _awesome_ album.
