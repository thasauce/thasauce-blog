Like them womp womps? We definitely do when not overdone. This week&#8217;s _Sound Bytes_ features yet another unassuming hard-hitter from [Dj Roborob](http://djroborob.bandcamp.com/) with his tribute to one of the leggiest women in gaming history, Chun Li. Just a warning though&#8230; hit the brief drop and frenetic wobbles may send your headphones/speakers/ears into a fantastic rhythmic frenzy for awhile. Listen at your own discretion!

Originally experimenting with chip music and eventually progressing through various genres such as house and dubstep, Dj Roborob is no stranger to mixing scene. You can hear more of his fantastic mixes on both [Bandcamp](http://djroborob.bandcamp.com/) and [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/dj-roborob).
