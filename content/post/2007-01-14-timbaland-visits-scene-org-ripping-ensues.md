  <a target="_blank" href="http://digg.com/music/Timbaland_ripped_off_a_track_from_my_buddy">Here is the Digg.com entry.</a></p> 
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s all explained there, even <a target="_blank" href="http://digg.com/music/Timbaland_ripped_off_a_track_from_my_buddy#c4713693">a few posts from Tempest himself</a>, but basically here&#8217;s the lowdown:</div> 
    
    <div align="justify">
      Timbaland used about 15 seconds of a song by Demoscener &#8220;Tempest&#8221; as the base for a Nelly Furtado song, which he &#8220;produced.&#8221; Tempest&#8217;s material is clearly audible when you listen to the Furtado track. You can hear the chip sounds and the distinct arpeggios. Tempest&#8217;s song is also quite popular, and he writes: &#8220;Acidjazzed Evening competed in Oldschool Music Compo at Assembly 2000<br /> in Helsinki, infront of more than 4000 people (voters) and won the<br /> competition. There are good documents on this. You can of course<br /> believe that the whole event never took place, but would require heavy<br /> dose of self-deluding and not doing your research properly.&#8221;</p>

        <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8N4ovp90Ea0">Here&#8217;s a YouTube video of the Nelly Furtado version.</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It&#8217;s unclear whether Tempest will go through the courts at this point in time, since he states he doesn&#8217;t have the time or the money to take on a major music label. He says much more in his Digg post, which I linked above.

        I haven&#8217;t heard Timbaland&#8217;s or Nelly&#8217;s response to all this, and I&#8217;m unsure if they&#8217;ll even respond at all, but if they do, please comment on this article and let me know [or I will post it, if I find it first].</div>
