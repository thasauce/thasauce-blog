So I&#8217;m admittedly pretty late on this one, as I&#8217;ve been pretty swamped with company the past few weeks, BUT genoboost over at <a href="http://gamemusic4all.blogspot.com" target="_self">GameMusic4All</a> has <a href="http://gamemusic4all.blogspot.com/2009/03/interview-with-nicole-adams-and-starla.html" target="_blank">a really great interview</a> with OCR&#8217;s newest female remixer, and long time community member, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/artist/4846/nicole-adams" target="_blank">Nicole Adams</a> and OCR&#8217;s very first remixer: <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/artist/4291/injury" target="_blank">injury</a>.

    About a year ago I had the pleasure of running across Nicole Adam&#8217;s<br /> music via myspace and was immediately amazed by the music she had<br /> there. I soon asked her if she would like to contribute a track to the<br /> 2nd GM4A anniversary compilation <a href="http://gamemusic4all.com/wtw2">Welcome to World 2</a>. She was kind enough to agree and submitted the song Permutation<br /> for the album, and I was of course blown away by how well it was all<br /> done. Another thing I was amazed by was that she worked with Starla AKA<br /> injury of OCReMix fame who provided her amazing voice and handled lyric<br /> duties on the song verses. Together they created a sweeping arrangement<br /> of the Donkey Kong Country song Fear Factory which has been the<br /> highlight of the album for many people.

    Flash forward a few months and now the song Permutation is <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01806/">featured on OCReMix</a><br /> and has been getting some great reviews. Due to the slightly momentous<br /> event I decided to shoot some questions to Nicole Adams to discuss what<br /> it is like to have her first song on OCR, and also Injury, who has<br /> returned to OCR with this song after a lengthy hiatus. I also took this<br /> opportunity to ask them about their music influences, upcoming projects<br /> and more. Check out the interview below, then be sure to check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/nicoleadams84">Nicole Adams music myspace</a> and check out <a href="http://injury.thasauce.net/">Injury over at her new website</a>!
