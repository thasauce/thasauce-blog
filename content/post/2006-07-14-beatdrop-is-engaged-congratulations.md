From the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=87495" target="_blank">thread on OCReMix</a>:

<span class="postbody">The dropper of the beats has gotten engaged.<br /> After having fallen madly in love with who was once my on-and-off<br /> lover, Christina, I proposed to her a couple days ago. We&#8217;re planning<br /> on having our wedding sometime in late October or early to mid-<br /> November in Bemidji, MN, so any OCR residents in the area should let me<br /> know if they are interested in attending, because I would be happy to<br /> send an invite.<br /> </span>
  
<span class="postbody"><br /> Sudden, perhaps, but incredible.</p> 

<p>
  And I apologize if you thought this would be some cool thread about dogfights or something.</span>
