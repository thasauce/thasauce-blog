Today, I&#8217;d like bring to your attention a doujin band by the name of
  
Preludio. Mainly guitar-based, they have a great arrangement
  
style, awesome technique, and just an all-around charismatic
  
sound. Their most recent album, _For All You FF Lovers_
  
covers music from every Final Fantasy up to the 9th game. You can
  
download a demo from their <a target="_self" href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/preludio/works/works.htm">works page</a>,
  
as well as several other miscellaneous MP3&#8217;s (including their rendition
  
of GT2&#8217;s &#8220;Moon Over The Castle&#8221;). No info as to how to obtain the
  
actual CD yet&#8230;there&#8217;s a link to a Japanese mail order site <a target="_self" href="http://www.toranoana.jp/mailorder/">here</a> (search for &#8220;Preludio&#8221;), but I&#8217;m unsure as to whether they accept international orders.

Still, what&#8217;s on their site should last you at least a little while. Again, it&#8217;s
  
all in Japanese, so you might need Babelfish to get around. Enjoy!
