It appears [The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess) (the latest installment of the [Legend of Zelda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series)
  
series) has been delayed yet again. It was originally slated for a Fall
  
2005 release, which was then pushed back to Spring 2006. Now, however,
  
you can look forward to a **Fall 2006 Release** of the much anticipated game.
