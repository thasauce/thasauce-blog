With some of ThaSauce regular featured artists like Laura Shigihara, A_Rival, Jake &#8220;virt&#8221; Kaufman, the newestÂ [Game Music Bundle 2](http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/)Â release has you covered in a extremely convenient &#8220;Pay What You Want&#8221; format.

Oh, and if you happen to contribute $10+, they&#8217;ll throw even _more_ VGM swag at you. As in, fifteen albums for the price of one fancy meal. Or one large pizza. Or maybe&#8230; oh, nevermind. At this rate, we have to say: **total steal**.
