<img border="0" align="right" src="http://xerol.org/h/v/1143/gh-ds.png" />Activision is finally making good on its promise to expand the Guitar Hero franchise to handhelds with the announcement of Guitar Hero: On Tour, a DS version of the popular game. The game uses a special 4-fret addon that goes into the GBA slot of the DS, and a special stylus to strum. The game will feature around two dozen songs and Wifi multiplayer.
