  MagiNinjA writes, &#8220;With the end of the Auld Lang Sine 3 deadline comes a bunch of original (or mostly original) albums created by artists within a one month frame. The official deadline was January 1st, 2006, Midnight GMT. Happy New Years to the U.K. and all countries with GMT!&#8221;

Whether Ubik will keep this deadline, I really doubt. At the deadline, entries had been received from: Warfreak2, soc, Fusion2004, Me (MagiNinjA), losty, and Xerol.
