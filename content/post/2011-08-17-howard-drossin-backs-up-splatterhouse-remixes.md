</center>Thanks to a tip from the amazing 

[Jeriaska](http://jeriaska.com/) of the VGM-based community [Nobuooo](http://nobuooo.com/), we&#8217;ve been on a huge [Howard Drossin](https://www.facebook.com/HowardDrossinComposer?sk=wall) kick lately. I mean, come on â€“ what is there not to like about this man&#8217;s talent? Known for his seemingly random (albeit kickass) collaborations with top honchos like jazz composer Terence Blanchard and hip-hop producer RZA, Drossin is especially known in the VGM scene for his continued participation in the _Sonic_ franchise over the years along with an impressive number of other notable scores as Sega&#8217;s former music director. If that doesn&#8217;t spark your fancy, the fact that Drossin&#8217;s work has been subjected asÂ  [one of the best OverClocked Remix albums of 2006](http://ocremix.org/album/9/sonic-3-and-knuckles-project-chaos) definitely should.

Anyway, enough fanboy talk. Even with his limited involvement within the video game industry lately, Drossin has done it again and released not one, but THREE amazing albums on Bandcamp. What really stands out for us, however, is Drossin&#8217;s open invitation for other independent game score composers to &#8216;butcher&#8217; his music from the 2010 _Splatterhouse_ remake. Appropriately titled _Butchered by Various Artists,_ this remix album features several notable musicians like [Chris Geehan](http://hyperduck.co.uk/), winner of Microsoft&#8217;s &#8216;Dream.Build.Play&#8217; Challenge and [Crashfaster](http://crashfaster.com/), composer of the incredibly addictive _Knifetank_ series. Independent Games Festival nominee [Mattias HaÌˆggstroÌˆm Gerdt](http://anosou.com/) and â€œMake Something RADDâ€ winner [Tony Dickinson](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/prince-of-darkness/) also make an epic appearance on the release.Â  In other words, brace yourself for free impressive remixing goodness. Yes, this album also happens to be obtainable forÂ  _free download_. What are you waiting for?

_[Butchered by Various Artists](http://howarddrossin.bandcamp.com/album/splatterhouse-remixes-butchered)_ as well as Drossin&#8217;s other phenomenal _Splatterhouse_ albums ([here](http://howarddrossin.bandcamp.com/album/splatterhouse-volume-1-metal) and [here](http://howarddrossin.bandcamp.com/album/splatterhouse-volume-2-cut-scenes-ambient-and-retro)) are available on Bandcamp now for download. Congratulations to everyone involved in the album, as well as Jeriaska for his own involvement in such an inspiring project.
