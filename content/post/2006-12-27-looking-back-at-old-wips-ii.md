Continue to look back at some old WIPs with ZeaLitY. Each WIP is linked so you can download them and personally listen. Highlights include WIPs from Mega Man X, Chrono Trigger, Super Mario Land, Unreal Tournament, and others.
  
<a href="cc.herograw.org/Zeality/IMC12-MetropolishZone" target="_blank">IMC12 &#8211; Sonic 2 &#8211; Metropolis Zone</a>

This was a fun Iron Mix competition that attracted a lot of attention and remixes. Space Cowboy and Suzumebachi made strong entries; &#8220;Blue Metro&#8221; was cited as having a Van Halen synth feel to it. There are a lot of &#8220;before they were famous&#8221; remixers on here, like Analoq, djcubez, Prophecy, Rellik, Overcoat, and maybe a couple others. Check it out and relive the competition; I&#8217;ve included some WIPs in there. All of it dates from March 3, 2003, when I downloaded the final archive.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_Darkesword_Mega_Man_X_Zero4_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">Darkesword &#8211; Mega Man X &#8211; Beamsabre Beat ZERO (WIP)</a>

Oh man, how laughably FruityLoopy can you get? Featuring the default snare and clap samples, this thing is a shining example of a WIP by a new remixer &#8212; a decent arrangement with pretty default execution. I think the finished version is up on OCR, so feel free to compare them. I grabbed this March 5, 2003.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_Steve_Schardein_Mega_Man_X_NewMixPreview%5bBoomerKuwanger%5d_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">Steve Schardein &#8211; Mega Man X &#8211; Boomer Kuwanger</a>

Here&#8217;s Steve again. Boomer Kuwanger&#8217;s Tower is sort of an underremixed theme; the source tune is very unique and intense. Instead of blatantly playing the first few high-pitched notes, Steve starts low and slowly builds things up. Things don&#8217;t get very far, though, and we&#8217;re left with one less Boomer Kuwanger stage remix. I grabbed this March 8, 2003. If you&#8217;re craving Mega Man X remixes, check the Rockman X &#8211; ALPH-LYLA doujin released in 1994 in Japan.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_Nex_Tetris_Russian_Roulette_OC_ReMix.mp3" target="_blank">Nex &#8211; Tetris &#8211; Russian Roulette</a>

And now it&#8217;s time for something you might actually keep. Nex does the timeworn and still-cool thing of starting with a chiptune and building it up into an asskicking remix. It&#8217;s still a WIP, so the beat / instrumentation are minimal and the song doesn&#8217;t go very many places. It degenerates into a FOUR ON THE FLOOR LET&#8217;S DANCE &#8220;E&#8221; GLOWSTICKS HOORAY at one point, but overall it retains some attitude as a Tetris remix. I used to leave WIPs on in the background as I played Unreal Tournament to cover some ground, and I can remember hearing this starting March 11, 2003.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_DJ_Orange_Chrono_Trigger_factory_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">DJOrange &#8211; CRONCO TIGGER &#8211; Factory</a>

I grabbed this March 11, 2003. It&#8217;s pretty simple, and in a world without factory remixes, it can pass. There&#8217;s a minimalist funk going on here. He later put out a WIP called Factory 2, which is hosted at the Chrono Compendium. I have no idea whatever became of DJOrange.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_MC_Radical%20Dreamers_dream-shore-sonata2_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">MC_Radical Dreamers_dream-shore-sonata2</a>

Here&#8217;s the rough edition of MC&#8217;s Dream Shore Sonata-Fantasy, found March 15, 2003. The aural quality is a bit low along with the bitrate, but even in this primitive state it shows the quality that eventually earned it status as an OCRemix.

B<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_Beatdrop_RaidenBeta_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">eatdrop &#8211; Raiden Beta</a>

You&#8217;ve heard Beatdrop&#8217;s Raiden remix; now hear the WIP. It&#8217;s less of an assault on the ears than the final product, utilizing a snappier and softer tone. All the basic arrangement is there, just waiting for the final production value increase to make it presentable and edgy. But you might find that the WIP has its own flair and appeal. This was a strong remix even in its infancy. I found it March 20, 2003.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_Strider_Yoko_Unreal_Tournament_Foregone_Destruction_unreal%20remix_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">Strider Yoko &#8211; Unreal Tournament &#8211; Foregone Destruction unreal mix</a>

The final version (with two WIPs behind it) debuted on VGMix with a driving rhythm and some samples courtesy of Xan Kriegor, the boss of Unreal Tournament&#8217;s single player mode. The first WIP is less in-your-face, and as a result has an attitude closer to the source tune&#8217;s. There&#8217;s some simple and effective DnB here, and the light, airy synth that kicks things off never gets annoying. This is a good addition to the playlists of Unreal game players. It found its way to my hard drive on March 20, 2003. As I recall, in the original thread at OCR, some guy had heard of Strider Yoko from elsewhere and couldn&#8217;t believe it was him.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_DJ_Ikronix_Super_Mario_Land_Cloud_Nine_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">DJ Ikronix &#8211; Super Mario Land &#8211; Cloud 9</a>

This is the version unavailable anywhere else (which&#8230;I guess isn&#8217;t saying much, since only one other later WIP is available on VGMix anyway). A remix of Super Mario Land&#8217;s ending theme, it maintains an airy and heavenly texture with a simple, little rhythm to take you away. This earns it high marks in staying faithful to and expanding upon the intent and mood of the source tune. Super Mario Land was probably the first video game I ever beat, and the ending theme blew me away. So I suppose I&#8217;m a little biased here. At any rate, Ikronix did release a second WIP on VGMix with a louder and more upfront synth sound. Find it when VGMix goes back up. I was happy to find this remix on March 20, 2003.

<a href="http://cc.herograw.org/Zeality/WIPs/WIP_ResidentEvilFreak_Chrono_Trigger_Glenns_Awakening_OC_Remix.mp3" target="_blank">ResidntEvilFreak &#8211; Chrono Trigger &#8211; Glenn&#8217;s Awakening</a>

ResidntEvilFreak had an incredible work ethic. He came onto the remixing scene as a frequent flyer of the WIP board, outputting a big catalogue while constantly improving. Then he completely disappeared, leaving behind these unfinished and unpolished works. Check out the interesting string sample and the bouncy little arrangement; it&#8217;s in a different vein than most remixes of &#8220;Longing of the Wind&#8221; (hah, not Wind Scene; that was a bad translation). It goes into Frog&#8217;s Theme thereafter and maintains a heroic little musical journey for the next couple of minutes. It&#8217;s nothing impressive or musically strong, but as a WIP, it gets an A grade. I downloaded it on April 8, 2003.

That&#8217;s all for this time. There are still more to come.
