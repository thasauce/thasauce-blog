I could&#8217;ve sworn <a href="http://www.gamergasm.com/main.htm" target="_blank">GamerGasm</a> had it&#8217;s own topic image&#8230;guess I&#8217;m gonna have to get on that. Anyway this is hardly NEW news, but seeing as GamerGasm has no way to track content rather than manually checking the site right now, a lot of people may have missed it&#8230;
  
On the agenda tonite, is the groundbreaking, earth- shattering, amazing, incredible launch of NIntendo DS Lite. As well we talk about Table Tennis and Hitman, as well as why Sony isn&#8217;t making sense anymore. All this and more, and all for free, because we love you. Enjoy.
