From [GameSpot](http://www.gamespot.com/news/6166532.html):

_&#8220;Before Will Wright concocted the PC juggernaut The Sims, his previous masterpiece was the metropolis-building SimCity. The franchise has evolved onto several systems since its debut on the PC in 1989 and was recently announced for release in Japan for the DS under the very workman-like name SimCity DS.&#8221;_

<img border="0" align="right" src="images/articles/simcityds.jpg" />The game appears to be somewhere in between SimCity 2000 and SC3k in terms of features and graphics. The article also mentions use of the DS&#8217;s unique features to expand on the original game. WiFi gets some use, but it&#8217;s not clear how it will be integrated into gameplay. 

SimCity DS will see a worldwide release this summer.
