The company which brought us the best selling PC of the Twentieth Century, Commodore, is back. This time around, the company which practically created the demoscene will be focusing on top end gaming machines.
  
Commodore will unveil more details at CeBIT in Germany, so for now all we have is speculation. The comments on the article range from &#8220;Hooray!&#8221; to &#8220;Just riding on the coattails of nostalgia.&#8221; We&#8217;ll just have to see in another week&#8217;s time.
