  Well, we had some trouble with this one. Andyjayne and UncleBen had to drop out which left us with two people, but Xerol and DjSammyG showed up late to fill in the two absences. And Xerol&#8217;s song placed better than mine ;o. Today&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Sunny Green Hills&#8221; so we had a lot of happy entries today.

  CompoSTs [short for<br /> Compo and SoundTempest put together :)] are thematic videogame music<br /> OHCs, held in #soundtempest on EsperNet. They are scheduled whenever<br /> anyone feels like compoing.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Formats allowed are mp3/ogg, and music modules [it,s3m,xm,mod].
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I<br /> host the CompoSTs personally and also participate. I pick the theme and<br /> regulate the start and end time. I also decide whether the channel<br /> votes on a winner or not [sometimes when I am tired, there is no voting<br /> :)]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Come hang out in #soundtempest, and please let me know if/when you would like to have one.
