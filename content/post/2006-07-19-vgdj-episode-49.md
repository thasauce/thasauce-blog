From the VGDJ website, &#8220;As is the case with the natural laws of the universe, we have
  
balanced last week&#8217;s slightly abridged episode with a decidedly
  
plus-size show that is sure to hit the spot. The culmination of our
  
Awkward Trivia Contest Giveaway is close at hand as we announce the
  
penultimate winner and the final question. Not to be forgotten,
  
Cyan_Ide and DrumUltimA have returned with their weekly reports (gee,
  
who do you think is missing?!) and of course, zircon&#8217;s &#8220;Flow Basket&#8221;
  
makes its debut appearance. Excitement! Mystery! Suspense! Tune in to
  
Episode 049, and don&#8217;t touch that dial!&#8221;<a href="http://www.vgdj.net/Shownotes/2006/07/vgdj-shownotes-049.html" target="_blank"></a>
