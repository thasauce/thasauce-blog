    Quite a few games never got a soundtrack release but have been brought<br /> to the mighty internet in form of game rips, either from the ROM or<br /> direct audio recordings. Here I&rsquo;m gonna mention a few that&rsquo;s worth<br /> looking into. From Software&rsquo;s extremely overlooked <strong>Lost Kingdoms II</strong> (known as Rune II in Japan) has some quirky music.

    From Software head composer <a target="_blank" href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/3031">Kota Hoshino</a> is joined by From Software regular <a target="_blank" href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/680">Yuji Kanda</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/400">Takeshi Yanagawa</a><br /> of Culdcept fame for the soundtrack, never released in stores, and it<br /> certainly has it&rsquo;s moments. A strange blend of ethnic, electronica and<br /> classic RPG music that makes up for the lack of sample quality with<br /> unique compositions. Highlights include <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zik1AJIEpM&#038;fmt=18">Battle</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvQCPBYftz4&#038;fmt=18">Gromtull Desert</a> </em>and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ABfSpvCj6M&#038;fmt=18"><em>Kendarie Fortress</em></a>. A must if you&rsquo;ve played the game.

    Whoopee Camp&rsquo;s PS1 cult hit <strong>Ore! Tomba</strong> also has<br /> some fantastic music. Happy-go-lucky music based mainly around<br /> mallet-type sounds and percussion with really strong melodies. This<br /> soundtrack went great with the crazy art style of Ore! Tomba, the<br /> pink-haired little boy battling against evil pigs, solving mysteries<br /> and helping people. Highlights include <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8AQuo2i0Y&#038;fmt=18">Dwarf Forest</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqr13V62jug&#038;fmt=18">Village of all Beginnings</a> </em>and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyezT-C604&#038;fmt=18"><em>Phoenix Mountain</em></a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/1455">Harumi Fujita</a><br /> (Pulstar, Blazing Star) and Nao Hatsutani really made a memorable<br /> soundtrack and it&rsquo;s a shame it goes unreleased. Since Ore! Tombe (or<br /> Tomba! or Tombi! as it&rsquo;s also known) is such a rare game many people<br /> will miss out on this so hunt down that game rip NOW!<strong><br /> </strong>

    <strong>Future Tactics: the Uprising </strong>might have been a bad game, I don&rsquo;t know, but goddamn the music is groovy. <a target="_blank" href="http://vgmdb.net/artist/1301">Tim Follin</a>,<br /> one of the best NES/SNES composers out there, finally got his hands on<br /> some real samples and made some fantastic tunes. The soundtrack is a<br /> groovy, funk-inspired blend of jazz flute infested jam sessions,<br /> extremely atmospheric semi-ambient pieces, folkmusic and<br /> balls-to-the-wall rock. The instruments sound authentic, the riffs are<br /> strong and Follin really showed why he was one of the greats (he&rsquo;s now<br /> retired from game music). Find it, enjoy it and beg to a god of your<br /> choice that Tim Follin gets back into game music.

    Long story short, there&rsquo;s a LOT of good VGM out there that never got<br /> a soundtrack release. That doesn&rsquo;t mean all hope is lost, game rips is<br /> fan effort at it&rsquo;s best and will give you hours of listening pleasure.<br /> It&rsquo;s probably not legal in SOME way but damnit, I fail to see anyhting<br /> wrong with it if the game never got a soundtrack release. Anyway, if<br /> you have any personal favorites be sure to let me know and I&rsquo;ll check<br /> them out.
