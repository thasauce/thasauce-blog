Scene on the go? That&#8217;s right. [NitroTracker](http://nitrotracker.tobw.net/index.php?cat_id=1)
  
is a tracker created by Tobias Weyand in the style of FastTracker II for the Nintendo DS.
  
NitroTracker can load and save XM modules, and use .wav files off your
  
flashcart or SD card as samples, or even record your own samples using the built
  
in microphone.
