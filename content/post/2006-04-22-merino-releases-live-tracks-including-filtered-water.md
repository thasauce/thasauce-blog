Anyone who was a regular listener to VG Frequency should be familiar with Merino&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.ThaSauce.net/ramaserv/Misc/Merino%20-%20Filtered%20Water%20(EC).mp3" target="_blank">Filter Water</a>,&#8221; and even those who were NOT regular listeners of VGF should probably get themselves aquianted with it to. 
  
Merino has updated their MySpace with LIVE version of Filter Water along with live versions of a few of their other songs including Search Lights and Smoke. All the songs are availible for streaming, downloading, **and** adding as your MySpace song, be sure to check them out.

Additionally you can pick up Merino&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://s95441576.onlinehome.us/merino/searchlights.html">Search Light EP</a> over at <a target="_blank" href="http://s95441576.onlinehome.us/merino/">their website</a>.
