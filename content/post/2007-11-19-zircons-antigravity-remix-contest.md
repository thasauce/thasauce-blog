<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zirconstudios.com/">zircon</a> has announced in his newsletter a remix competition involving two tracks from his album <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdbaby.com/zircon3">Antigravity</a>. We can infer from this that he&#8217;s probably got another album coming out late winter/early spring 2008:

  &#8220;Starting today, you can download remix packs of both &#8220;Warhead&#8221; and &#8220;Mindbender&#8221; and create your own remixes of them. You&#8217;re welcome to distribute them as you please provided you credit me as the original artist, and there is no money involved; if you plan on selling your remix in some form, please talk to me first and we can work something out.&#8221;
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  &#8220;Additionally, I&#8217;m starting a friendly contest revolving around these<br /> remix packs. If you complete a remix of either track &#8211; in any style you want &#8211; send it to <a href="mailto:admin@zirconstudios.com">admin@zirconstudios.com</a>. I&#8217;ll compile all the remixes I get and on Feb 1, 2008, I&#8217;ll select two of them to be featured on my next album (and the winners will of course get a cut of the sales, too!) Alternatively, if there are too many good ones to pick from, I&#8217;ll open it up to the public to vote on.&#8221;
