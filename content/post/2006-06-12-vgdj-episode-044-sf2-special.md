This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):

We&#8217;re
  
back from Video Games Live with a vengeance, delivering another
  
plus-sized episode for your listening pleasure! Street Fighter 2 is the
  
theme, and we&#8217;ve got Shael Riley on board with us for an extended
  
interview about the latest OC ReMix project, [Blood on the Asphalt](http://sf2.ocremix.org/). The usual suspects Cyan_Ide, Rama, and DrumUltimA are back with their weekly reports, (welcome back, guys!)
  
and of course we&#8217;ve got our other regular features, as well as some
  
tasty tidbits about video game music on the radio. Finally, ever wonder
  
if your favorite hosts ever slip up here and there&#8230;? Dig it!
  
[00:00] A timeless mystery: WTF is Ryu saying?!  
[00:54] Our hosts are pumped up
  
for a butt-kickin&#8217;, Street Fighter 2-themed show. In fact, with your
  
help, we&#8217;ve fought our way to the top of the music charts on [PodcastAlley](http://www.podcastalley.com/). So just [keep those assists coming](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140) and we&#8217;ll be one step closer to &#8216;world champion&#8217;!  
[04:28] The Rama Report: May results for [Dwelling of Duels](http://dod.vgmix.com/) are in ([goat](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/goat/) came in first) and [June&#8217;s DoD theme](http://dod.vgmix.com/current.php) is Goemon, Mystical Ninja. VGM remixer [xoc](http://www.myspace.com/xoc) releases a [new, experimental album](http://www.archive.org/details.php?identifier=mega025). [zyko](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/zyko/) has also released a [new album](http://inverteddungeon.com/triacesuperfan/SnappleMan/) of original music, entitled &#8220;Survival&#8221;, at VGmix. Rama has finished an [OCR skin for Winamp 3](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=85502), but more importantly, has been working with Dhsu on an OCR-skinning and customization project called &#8220;[OverClocked ReMix ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=85409)&#8220;.  
[10:37] ReMix Review: From [Metal Slug 2](http://www.ocremix.org/game/metalslug2/): &#8216;[No Need to Reload](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01482/)&#8216; by [RoeTaKa](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/roetaka/)
  
&#8230; After numerous very close attempts at getting a ReMix on the site,
  
this was the winner for Roe, and for good reason! This mix is a
  
high-octane, over-the-top synth rock track that can be easily likened
  
to the energetic remixes of [S.S.H.](http://ssh.ne.jp/) The gritty and edgy sound might not be everyone&#8217;s favorite, but there&#8217;s no denying the quality of this one.  
[14:27] The Compo Report: A slightly sickly Cyan_Ide encourages us to participate in and vote on various competitions: [TOMC13](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84505&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), [FLMC2](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=80879&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), [PRC69](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84854&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), and [ORC48](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84884&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0). Awwww, snufflenutters! ;_;  
[16:56] Video game music and radio? Inconceivable, but it&#8217;s true! [GameMusicRadio](http://gamemusicradio.com/)
  
features 24/7 streaming VGM (American and Japanese), as well as two
  
radio shows that can be downloaded on demand, much like ours.
  
Meanwhile, [RadioSEGA](http://radio.mysega.co.uk/) is a
  
UK-based internet stream also featuring 24/7 music (of course, only
  
SEGA tunes) with no talking. If you enjoy our show, give these two
  
virtual stations a listen.  
[19:57] The Meetup Report: [Australia meetups](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=83917)
  
are being developed, with a definite Sydney meetup on July 1st at the
  
Town Hall steps. Perth and Briz-BUN meetups are also planned for July,
  
but have not been set in stone.  
[23:03] Russian ReMix Roulette:
  
Will zircon&#8217;s fantasy of seven-sharp piano music be fulfilled? What
  
about pixietricks and her deep-rooted TO bias? The answer is a
  
resounding &#8220;NO&#8221;; oh well, even the presence of Tommy Tallarico couldn&#8217;t
  
help our luck, so we don&#8217;t feel so bad. Anyway, [orkybash](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/orkybash/)&#8216;s mix isn&#8217;t bad either &#8211; from [Final Fantasy 6](http://www.ocremix.org/game/ff6/): &#8216;[Ruined Skies](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00748/)&#8216;.  
[31:52] [Shael Riley](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/shaelriley/): veteran ReMixer, community hero, and director of the Super Street Fighter 2: Turbo Project, [Blood on the Asphalt](http://sf2.ocremix.org/).
  
He has joined us for an extensive interview covering the concept of the
  
project, its history, the ups and downs, and much more. Thanks for the
  
interview, dude! Awesome job to everyone involved. Also, check out
  
Shael&#8217;s [original album](http://www.shaelriley.com/toybox/), jam packed with ridiculous fun!   
[53:01]
  
VOICEMAIL: Thanks Rama, Rexy, and Fusion2004! As you can see from
  
Rexy&#8217;s example, international callers ARE in fact able to reach our
  
number. If you&#8217;re British, this should work for you:  
* Dial the access number for calls to the United States &#8211; check [here](http://www.telediscount.co.uk/accessnumbers.php#u) for the number, which sometimes changes once in a while.   
*
  
When it says &#8220;please enter the number you would like to call and finish
  
by pressing the hash (#) button&#8221; you just type 00 and THEN the VGDJ
  
number. In this case it&#8217;s 001 800 990 VGDJ (8435 if you can&#8217;t see any
  
letters imprinted on your phone).   
* If you hear the VGDJ intro
  
music followed by our hosts speaking about the answering machine, you
  
know you&#8217;re at the right place.
