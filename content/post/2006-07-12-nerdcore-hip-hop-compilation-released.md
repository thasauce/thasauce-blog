So I knew this was being worked on, but I didn&#8217;t know it had actually been COMPLETED (almost a month ago) until the review popped up on slashdot today, so maybe other people missed it to. 
  
The slashdo review mentioned that about half the songs are pretty eh, but the other half is excellent, though they didn&#8217;t mention which tracks specifically. When I talked to Shael about it earlier today he pretty much said the same thing.

The most notable songs on the compilation however is a track by Shael himself and another by Mythril Nazgul (as myf). If you listen to nothing else from this compilation, listen to both of those because I&#8217;ve heard them and they are both EXCELLENT.

The entire compilation can be downloaded here:
