Thats right, the first emulator for the PSP has just been released. Developed by <span class="postbody">Mr. MIRAKICHI, it runs GB emulation pretty smoothly with no sound. The story was first broke on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.2ch.net/2ch.html">2ch</a> forums and then posted in the <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1648">ps2dev.org</a> forums. A picture can be seen <a target="_blank" href="http://psp.holybell.to/uploader/upload/PICT0791.jpg">here</a>.<br /> </span>
