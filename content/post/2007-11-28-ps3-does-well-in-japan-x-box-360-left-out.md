&#8230;in the cold, apparently.

I have been doing a lot of reading lately on news articles such as these mainly because I look for perspective on the gaming industry. Well, I found an interesting one in this article. Apparently Sony&#8217;s PS3 has, for the first time since launch, sold more in Japan than Nintendo&#8217;s Wii. I thought that was pretty amazing considering PS3&#8217;s launch was a horrible, horrible lesson in supply and demand, as well as proper pricing, as you have seen from the more recent $100 price drop on the PS3.
  
Also, and probably more importantly, X-box 360 is having compatibility
  
issues with Halo 3, according to the article, gamers are complaining
  
that it&#8217;s not fully compatible with the hardware. As if that wasn&#8217;t bad
  
enough, there is also a class-action lawsuit that has been filed by
  
said gamers. On top of console &#8220;meltdowns&#8221;, literally, as well as
  
breakdowns, Microsoft has put aside somewhere in the neighborhood of $1
  
billion to address the issue.

Also, for you investors out there, EA and Activision stock is up. Huzzah!
