A detailed account and a mini-interview concerning the recent Passion! VGM concerts in Australia has been released by the Chrono Compendium. I don&#8217;t mean to blatantly plug my site, but there are some pictures interspersed in the feature and a lot of italic / bold formatting that would be a hassle to reproduce here. Anyway, if that hasn&#8217;t turned you off yet, you can find the report <a href="http://www.chronocompendium.com/Stories/40.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Due to some complications, the videos of the concert still aren&#8217;t out, but jesus, I&#8217;ll post them when they get here.
