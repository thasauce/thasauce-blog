Novelty mice for PCs never really made a
  
splash in the marketplace. One reason may be the ergonomics of a mouse
  
crafted like a hamburger hardly make for comfortable web surfing or
  
extensive sessions of one&#8217;s latest gaming addiction. To add to the crop
  
of uncomfortable novelty mice, Banpresto has announced Mario and Goomba
  
versions which may appeal to retro Famicom fans. The promotional sheet
  
for the mice lists compatibility with PCs only but since there are no
  
special software drivers, we&#8217;re guessing that they&#8217;ll work with Macs as
  
well. Preorders are welcome today to ship in mid-late November 2005.
