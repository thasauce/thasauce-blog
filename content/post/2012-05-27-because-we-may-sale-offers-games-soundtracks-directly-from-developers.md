Listen to amazing soundtracks while receiving great deals on several award-winning multi-platform games with the [Because We May](http://www.becausewemay.com/index.html) sale, **on now through June 1st**:

> We believe thatÂ developers should have the freedom to price their games how they like, without interference from the online stores that sell the games. Why? Because it allows us to promote our games more freely, as we are doing here! We rely on the ability to promote our games for our livelihood and control over pricing is an important tool for this purpose. For the last week of May (May 24 through June 1) our games will be deeply discounted to celebrate online stores that give us control over pricing:Â The App Store, Google Play, Steam, Desura, IndieVania, and a few others.

&#8216;Tis the year for great deals on independent games that gamers may or may not have heard of and what better to celebrate May with even more discounts? With some of the best highly praised soundtracks from _World of Goo_ by Kyle Gabler_,_ [Jim Guthrie](http://www.jimguthrie.org/)&#8216;sÂ _Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP_ (which wonÂ Best Videogame Music of 2011 at [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/5871943/the-actual-best-game-music-of-2011-superbrothers-sword--sworcery-ep)), _OSMOS_ byÂ Â [Loscil](http://www.myspace.com/loscil),Â [Gas 0095](http://microscopics.co.uk/electronic_music.html),Â [Julien Neto](http://typerecords.com/releases/le-fumeur-de-ciel), &Â [High Skies](http://microscopics.co.uk/electronic_music.html#sounds_of_earth)_,_ andÂ some 8-bit chippage inÂ _EDGE,_Â Because We May allows you to have access to over 50+ games that will satisfy all your aural and gaming needs.

The Because We May promotion seems to be only taking place this week, with no news as to whether or not more substantial discounts on independently developed games will be made available in the future. With that being said, get on this great deal now and take time to browse the incredibly varied game selection [here](http://www.becausewemay.com/).
