Anyone remember the first Auld Lang Sine contest? Hosted by Ubik this
  
time around, this contest is mainly centered around the Hellven.org
  
community. Because Hellven has so many major members from the VG
  
remix scene, such as Ubik and mv, the contest spilled over into VGmix, with past ALS1 submissions by myself, Gwilym, zyko, and
  
Dennis Mott.
  
For more information, visit

or

Anyone familiar with the old contest will see a new change. Remixes,
  
covers, and arrangements are now acceptable as long as they take up
  
1/3rd or less of your tracks.

The deadline is August 1st, folks, so mark your calendars. This is a _big_ event!
