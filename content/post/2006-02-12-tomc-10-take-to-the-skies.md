The tenth installment of the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76984" target="_blank">Thematic Original Music Competition</a>, where entrants compose an original track,Â is underway. The winner of TOMC 9, Flik, chose an airship theme:

&#8220;_This would be a theme for the skies. Many games have you leaving the ground on a dragon, an airship, or something of the like. Feel the breeze upon your face as you take to the skies on a quest to the Castle in the Clouds.   
_ 
  
_I didn&#8217;t want to get too descriptive as to make you feel obligated to follow a certain route. Best of luck to all, and I look forward to hearing your interpretations of this theme_.&#8221;

The competiton runs through Midnight (EST) on Saturday, February 21st.
