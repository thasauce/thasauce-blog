If anyone has any trouble downloading any songs lately, it&#8217;s because
  
I&#8217;ve been reuploading all of them to fix a number of ID3v2 issues.
  
There were a few tags that were inconsistent with out conventions, but
  
most importantly since I have a Mac now I noticed that without the
  
&#8220;album artist&#8221; field filled in, the songs won&#8217;t group together under a
  
single album. So I made sure to update all of them and am in the
  
process of re-uploading.

Should be done sometime later this morning, followed by a new song post!
