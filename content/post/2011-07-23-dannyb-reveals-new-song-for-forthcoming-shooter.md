Composer extraordinaire Danny Baranowsky, also known as [DannyB](http://dbsoundworks.com/), has just released a new song for _Super Meat Boy_ co-creator Edmund McMillen's upcoming game, _The Binding of Isaac._ As his first non-Team Meat project, McMillen's new shooter [has been described](http://pc.ign.com/articles/118/1181717p1.html?RSSwhen2011-07-12_060400&RSSid=1181717&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ignfeeds%2Fall+%28IGN+Complete%29) as a interesting cross between the _Legend of Zelda_ series, the Bible, and Satanism. Two words: absolutely stoked. With an awesome industrial score to be expected from DannyB, we're pumped for forthcoming release of _The Binding of Isaac,_ coming to Steam next month!

Although the official soundtrack is still in progress, check out DannyB's new song â€œSacrificialâ€ for _The Binding of Isaac_ [right here](http://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/the-binding-of-isaac-soundtrack).__
