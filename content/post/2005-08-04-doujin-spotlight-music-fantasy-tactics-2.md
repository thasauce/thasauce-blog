<div>
  Music Fantasy Tactics 2, the followup to last year&#8217;s FF Tactics/Advance arrangement project, has now finally been <a href="http://mft.exdeath.jp/" target="_blank">officially unveiled.</a><br /> Organized by Dynastess, it features 26 tunes and 25 participants.<br /> Definitely worth checking out for any fan of FFT or just good music in<br /> general.</p> 
  
  <p>
    The tracks can be downloaded <a href="http://mft.exdeath.jp/files/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a> (Note: The files are compressed using the LZH format, so you will need an appropriate program to extract the MP3s).</div>
