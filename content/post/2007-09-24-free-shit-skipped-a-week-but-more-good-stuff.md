The week before last was pretty dry, but [fortunately?] ThaSauce was down, so I had an excuse not to write my column! This past week saw a lot of neat stuff though.

Sweet ambient from Alexey V. Dark and stylish, with a nice deep sound to it. He has 3 other releases on kahvi, and I recommend those as well, particularly <a href="http://kahvi.org/113.php" target="_blank">Serbia</a>

Loopy, kooky, fun hip hop. Thanks for all that karate, karate kid.

SERIOUS BUSINESS dance track, reminiscient of <a href="http://soundtempest.net/soc/single/oc-carthage.mp3" target="_self">Carthage</a> [my Reunion release] but a little different. Everyone&#8217;s gotta put ethnic instruments to beats eventually though.

Two from <a href="http://www.reunionstudio.org/" target="_blank">Reunion Studio</a> in this column, they&#8217;re good at keeping with their 1 track a week schedule ðŸ™‚ Zircon&#8217;s track is considerably lighter than Freeman&#8217;s, a bit more playful and fun, and as usual, the kind of mainstream-ish crowdpleasing style you&#8217;re used to from Zircon. This song is a remix of one of his tracks off of his album <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/zircon3" target="_blank">Antigravity</a>, which he is always telling me to buy. If you&#8217;d like to support zircon and give him a little pocket change, consider buying this album.

No voices here [pun]. This is Free Shit&#8217;s first taiko drum song though.  
&#8220;I got to do a user demo for a new sample library called Tsaiko Drums
  
and I wanted to do something that had the feel of a good ol&#8217; fashioned
  
taiko drum concert as an homage to my favorite taikoist, Joji Hirota
  
(so it&#8217;s definitely ala his style):&#8221; &#8211; Dan  
A short and fun drumming tune you should check out ðŸ™‚ I think the sample library sounds pretty damn good, myself.

&#8220;i&#8217;m trying to do a project something along the indie-rockish lines yah know w/ guitars and vocals and all that.&#8221; -transient  
This is different from usual Transient. Not so different though. It just has more guitars and more singing ðŸ˜€

You will play this with subwoofers.

It&#8217;s what Joshua Morse usually makes, but this time&#8230; with FM synths! You should really really really get this if you enjoy music. Me being a Genesis fan anyway makes me fall in love with anything that sounds like this regardless of composition, but Joshua Morse has really got a knack for making a sexy groove. Save this to your computer.
