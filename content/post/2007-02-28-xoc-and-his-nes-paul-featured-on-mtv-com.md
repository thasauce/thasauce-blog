  Yes, that&#8217;s right. Remember XOC and his crazy NES guitar? Well, MTV got wind of it, and thought it was cool enough to post an interview with him on their site. XOC made a bulletin on MySpace about the interview, which is how I found out about it. He doesn&#8217;t really say anything about it himself, though the full interview is available <a href="http://www.mtv.com/games/video_games/obsessed/10071049.jhtml#/games/video_games/obsessed/10071049.jhtml?obsessedId=10071049&#038;view=interview" target="_blank">here</a>, along with a picture of him and his crazy hair. And of course, the NES Paul.</p>
