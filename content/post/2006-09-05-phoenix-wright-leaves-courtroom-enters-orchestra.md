<div>
  Fans of Phoenix Wright are in for a treat this fall when Capcom releases two CDs of music rearranged in orchestral form from the game series.
</div>

<div>
  The arrangements of the songs are being done by Noriyuki Iwadare, of Grandia, Radiata Stories, and Gyakuten Saiban 3 fame (among others).
</div>

The first CD will go on sale September 30 exclusively at Tanomi.com, while the second will be available for purchase at the Capcom merchandise booth at this month&#8217;s Tokyo Game Show. It will then be released to the general Japanese public in November.

No stateside release is expected, so the only way to get these domestically will be via import.

<div>
  The two albums will feature songs from the first three Gyakuten Saiban games.
