<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01631/">Metal Slug 3 &#8216;Light &#8216;Em Up&#8217;</a> write-up:

_So, of all the names involved in this flood, Ari&#8217;s might be the most
  
surprising; his relationship with the judges panel, the overall site,
  
and me personally has certainly had its ups and downs, putting it
  
tactfully. However, for the recent [Content Policy discussion](http://www.ocremix.org/info/Content_Policy),
  
we needed his input, since he has a significant body of work on the
  
site. We talked on IM and I unbanned him from our forums since
  
everything seemed mellow and relatively copasetic, and thus far this
  
hasn&#8217;t proven a major mistake on my part. My Spidey-Sense tells me that
  
with time and distance tends to come perspective and objectivity, and
  
hopefully that&#8217;s the case on both sides. Regardless, he&#8217;s submitted a
  
badass Metal Slug 3 mix, so any past dramarama is really secondary if
  
not tertiary, as there&#8217;s some musical butt to be kicked._
  
This song is part of an &#8220;old school&#8221; flood on OverClocked ReMix. Other songs are still TBA. Stay tuned ðŸ˜®
