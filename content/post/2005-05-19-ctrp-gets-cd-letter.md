<span class="postbody">The Chrono Trigger Remake Project has received a<br /> ceast & desist letter from SquareEnix. Although nominated most<br /> likely candidate to get such an order, no one truly believed it would<br /> happen. It&#8217;s as if a warning siren has blared to all Chrono modders. I<br /> advise everyone to take your projects underground if it&#8217;s of something<br /> grand like CTRP. TheBrain offers a few words on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chrono-trigger.com/">http://www.chrono-trigger.com</a><br /> : &#8220;We from the CTRP team would like to say sorry to Square-Enix, Co.<br /> Ltd. and its affiliates. We didn&#8217;t realize that a fan game would be so<br /> harmful to your business.&#8221; Although it&#8217;s tough to say this, the only<br /> good thing that could come of this recent C&D order is the hint<br /> that something Chrono related could be in the works. It also means SE<br /> cares about the franchise enough to take down something inifinitely<br /> smaller than Chrono Trigger Resurrection. Anyway, do watch yourself<br /> from now on.<br /> </span>
