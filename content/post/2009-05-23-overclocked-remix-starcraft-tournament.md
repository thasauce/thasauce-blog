  Ok guys! I was saying the other day on IRC that we should have a<br /> small-potatoes SC tournament, and even offered to donate 20 dollars for<br /> a prize (either cash or whatever you guys would deem appropriate)! I<br /> was hearing that there is already some interest (most notably Nekofrog,<br /> Tensei-san, and Battousai) and wanted to see if there were other folks<br /> who&#8217;d want to get in on something like this.

  I was figuring that we<br /> could even record the replays with commentary if people were<br /> comfortable having other folks watch their games&#8230; even though I doubt<br /> many of us here are really &#8220;good enough&#8221; to warrant actually having a<br /> VOD, it&#8217;d be nice to see our own flaws and compare strats.What do you guys think? You can message me on IRC or Steam (add me: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/garianse" target="_blank">https://steamcommunity.com/id/garianse</a>) but please not here because I hardly ever check my messages or email.</p>

    Update May 22:<br /> It seems most people want to have two tourneys, a 1v1 series and a 2v2<br /> series pairing people by their skill. Each round of the tournament will<br /> be decided by a best of 3 matches. I&#8217;m thinking that we should maybe<br /> aim for a mid-to-late June date to begin playing, but I don&#8217;t want that<br /> to be set in stone until we&#8217;ve got some more of the details hammered<br /> out. If you&#8217;re wanting to &#8220;sign up,&#8221; go ahead and make a post with the<br /> race you play and the name you&#8217;ll be playing under. Check this post for<br /> future updates!
