EDIT: Maybe it is happening. I dunno!

SPAMTRON will be playing live on the 22nd of March at 19:00 at &#8220;MC Firedrill&#8217;s Fortress of Pwn&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure where that actually is, but rest assured I will be there also, rocking out to Spamtron&#8217;s chiptunes and stuff. If you&#8217;re in the Northwest you need to come check this out. Spamtron is a CRAZY EXCITING DUDE and you&#8217;re missing out if you haven&#8217;t met him or seen him play yet. I may update this news post later with directions to the place, if you&#8217;re in the area and wanna come check this out.
