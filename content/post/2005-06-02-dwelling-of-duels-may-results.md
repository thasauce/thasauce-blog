<span class="small">The Dwelling of Duels, a monthly (and<br /> occasionally bi-monthly) competition where people who play instruments<br /> (mostly guitarists, but some play piano or even saxaphone) cover or arrange<br /> video game music, has just wrapped up for the month of May.<br /> </span><span class="small"><br /> </span>
  
<span class="small">This month was themed for entries from Konami games. The top three winners were:</p> 

<p>
  <strong><br /> 1st:</strong> goat &#8211; Castlevania &#8211; Scourge of 1691 (116 pts)
</p>

</p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  <span class="small"><br /> </span><span class="small">The theme for the month of June will be a &#8216;free&#8217; month, meaning any song from any game is allowed, as long as it meets the <a href="http://dod.rock-out.net/rules.html">rules</a>.</p> 
  
  <p>
    The new due date for songs is Monday the 27th of this month, by 6 AM<br /> PST. If you don&#8217;t feel up to making a full 2 minute song, there is also<br /> a special competition themed towards joke songs. All the information<br /> for that is contained <a href="http://dod.rock-out.net/specials/joke/">here.</a><br /> </span><br /> <span class="small"><br />More information about DoD can be found on <a href="http://dod.rock-out.net/">the website</a>.</span>
