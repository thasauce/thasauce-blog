A few weeks ago, GeoffreyTaucer had an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=91437">idea</a>: a database of live performers. Well, a few days later, <a target="_blank" href="http://live.xerol.org/index.php">it&#8217;s here</a>.
  
The database is &#8220;simply&#8221; searchable at the moment, meaning you can type in any phrase and it will return anyone who has that exact phrase (not case-sensitive) in their &#8220;skills&#8221; section. There is also room to provide plenty of contact information, as well as room to list your preferred styles, a bit about yourself, and anything else you feel people would need to know.

Over the next few weeks we&#8217;ll creep new features in, like a messaging system, improved search, and a matching area where performers and composers can get together. Think of it as a matchmaking service for remixers.
