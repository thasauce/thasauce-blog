Notorious(ly bad) film director [Uwe Boll](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0093051/) recently challenged and fought several of his &#8220;harshest&#8221; critics, including Richard &#8220;Lowtax&#8221; Kyanka of [somethingawful.com](http://www.somethingawful.com/), in an amateur boxing match in Vancouver.
  
The director invited 5 of his critics to Vancouver for the fight, and
  
actually fought 4 of them in the ring. He refused to fight the 5th
  
contender, however, for reasons unknown (some sources cite the fact
  
that the 5th critic had recieved professional boxing training, others
  
that the 5th was in fact a minor and Boll refused to fight him on those
  
grounds).

You can read more about it [HERE](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5376574.stm), or see a clip of the fight (along with some of Lowtax&#8217;s commentary) [HERE](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/clips/clips-uwe-boll-pushing-lowtaxs-face-in-202896.php).
