So by now you should know [why you, as a musician especially, should have a YouTube Profile](http://thasauce.net/2011/02/24/why-youtube-is-especially-important-for-musicians/ "Why YouTube is especially important for Musicians"), you know [how to optimize your videos and music for YouTube](http://thasauce.net/2011/03/03/how-to-optimize-your-youtube-videos/ "How to optimize your YouTube videos"), but there&#8217;s one more thing missing: How to optimize your profile itself. There&#8217;s not TOO much you can do with your YouTube profile as far as optimization goes, but it&#8217;s a goodÂ opportunityÂ to talk a little bit about yourself, get some links out there, and direct users to other outlets such as Facebook, twitter, your personal website, etc.Â The absolute best example I can give for this is [OverClocked ReMix&#8217;s YouTube Profile](http://www.youtube.com/user/ocremix).

Some important things to remember are:

  * **Use your whole description, and every field you have that&#8217;s relevant**. If you get X amount of characters, use as many of them as you can. Drop as many links in there as are relevant, and make sure you list them in the order of importance. Every bit of information about you in there is more information that _someone_ will read.
  * **Make your background image relevant.** Have the address to your mainsite, twitter, Facebook, etc. You can even include a small description of yourself and your music as well. Remember information in the background displays above the fold (aka &#8220;near the top part of the page, before the user has to scroll down&#8221;). This is some of the first information they&#8217;ll see. Some users won&#8217;t scroll down at all, make sure you make your information veryÂ accessible. Try not to go over board with how &#8220;busy&#8221; your background was. Don&#8217;t let your information get distracting, and make sure the information that you want to put forefront is visible and obvious.

That&#8217;s really all I have. As I said, there&#8217;s not too much you can do, but there are steps you can take. I can&#8217;t emphasize enough that you **should text every stop possible.** Every little bit helps. As always, any questions or suggestions, just leave a comment, and I&#8217;ll catch you next week.
