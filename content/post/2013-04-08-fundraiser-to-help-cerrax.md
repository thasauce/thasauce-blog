ThaSauce is not only a news site, it is a portal for the community.

Recently, Charlie Koch &#8212; known to us as Cerrax &#8212; suffered a personal tragedy. A fire destroyed his apartment, destroying his and his sister&#8217;s personal belongings. This tragedy has hit them terribly, both emotionally and financially.

We would like to take a moment to ask the community to come together to help out. A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CharlieAndBlairFundraiser" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=UvmOq2UiLA0pw1PhLZuC1TGhQBmF5pHarbda9MuFXPlJGRnml2-SLnW_8tS&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5348ead9d61c709ee8c979deef3ea735" target="_blank">Paypal fundraiser</a> have been set up, to help Cerrax and his sister save up the money needed to replace their belongings.

Anything you can contribute with will help &#8212; and will be appreciated.
