Alright guys, I need your help. It is my personal opinion that SoundTempest, or what SoundTempest once was, needs to be revived in full. Our channel, #soundtempest on EsperNet, is still alive, and we have OHCs every now and then, however, it&#8217;s only a shadow of what ST used to be &#8211; a full community devoted to aiding both budding, promising musicians and game developers alike.

  Since Andrew [zircon] is using SoundTempest as one of his main hosting sites still, simply reviving SoundTempest under the same name is impossible. So I&#8217;m thinking of new ones. I like the idea of a garden, there&#8217;s a whole metaphor for &#8220;growing&#8221; there. Outlawed words: &#8220;Sector, Section, Depot, Station&#8221; :). Maybe &#8220;dev-garden&#8221; since it has to do with game development in a way?</p> 
  
  <p>
    Anyway, the reason I&#8217;m thinking up names already is because I like how SoundTempest operated already. It worked. We got some interest from game developers, and there&#8217;s that whole Waerloga deal I had ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ :D. However, I still need help with site layout and logo, so if you guys could offer your help, that would be awesome, since I have experience in neither web OR logo design

    I&#8217;m currently negotiating with ThaSauce crew about hosting [thanks guys!], so we might have that covered.

    I&#8217;ve got that feeling in my gut. This will be a success! I look forward to a great site.</div>
