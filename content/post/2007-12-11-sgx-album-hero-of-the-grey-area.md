According to a post by SGX himself on the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=13637" target="_blank">OverClocked Remix forums</a>, tomorrow (Wednesday, December 12), his new album, _Hero of the Grey Area_, goes on sale. But this is far from an ordinary sale of a CD album of his. This sale starts at, for a limited time, $4.99! Are you outta your mind? No says SGX, this is all just an experiment. _

The information comes straight at you from the man himself:

&#8220;I have streaming previews of every track on the album, downloads of all
  
the previews and full songs available at the page above. If you follow
  
my stuff, you&#8217;ll know that I do release some of the tracks I put on my
  
albums to gather interest, but I&#8217;ve only released two full tracks and a
  
few shortened versions for free from this album. There&#8217;s about 40
  
minutes of tunes you haven&#8217;t heard yet on this album. Also, everything
  
has been professionally mastered, so you haven&#8217;t heard the NIIICE
  
sounding versions of the tracks either.

I&#8217;m doing a little experiment with the pricing of the download version &#8211; **For a possibly limited time, I&#8217;m setting the price at $4.99 to start, with the option of &#8216;tipping&#8217; me if you should so please.**
  
Normally, I think I&#8217;d set the price at $7.99, so I&#8217;m going to watch how
  
much comes in, and decide in a month or so to put it back to fixed
  
pricing or not.&#8221;

Also, SGX is giving buyers a choice between high quality VBR MP3 and FLAC lossless audio formats.

Also, don&#8217;t forget about scoring a copy of the physical CD itself:

&#8220;The physical CD is set at $14.99 with free shipping. Whenever you buy a
  
physical item from me, you also get the download version free so that
  
you can listen right away. If you&#8217;ve ever seen copies of the limited
  
edition Chroma, Outmoded, or SGXRMX2, you&#8217;ll know I do discs up right
  
with sexy on-disc printing and a nice deluxe jewel case from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jewelboxing.com/">these guys</a>.

The Album will also go on sale at cdbaby.com and iTunes as soon as
  
cdbaby gets done processing and setting it all up. Can&#8217;t give a
  
specific date on those.&#8221;

If
  
you&#8217;ve ever heard SGX&#8217;s music, then you know it&#8217;s totally quality. I
  
suggest you pick it up as soon as possible before supplies run out! And
  
you know they will!
