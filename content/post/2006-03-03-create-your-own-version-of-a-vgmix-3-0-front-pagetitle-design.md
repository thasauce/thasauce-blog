<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/VGMix">VGmix</a> may be down but our spirit is not :). I started up <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgmix.com/vg25/viewtopic.php?id=312">a thread over<br /> at the temp forums</a> that encourages all to design thier own take on how
  
they&#8217;d create the new title page/ logo for VG mix 3.0 :)! To my
  
suprize, it&#8217;s getting some feedback and I just thought I&#8217;d spread the
  
news. I think it&#8217;s a cool way to show support for everyone working hard
  
on it. You know (keep the dream alive!) err somthing ;). If nothing
  
else, it&#8217;s a good time waster and it&#8217;s pretty fun :)!
  
Can&#8217;t wait to see what you all come up with :)! (Join us&#8230;(you know you want to :P! The link is in the title, have fun :).
