Drew Wheeler, also known as [halc](http://halc.bandcamp.com/), has started preorders for his first full-length album, _[Pixel Perfect Complete](http://halc.bandcamp.com/album/pixel-perfect-complete),_ to be released on **June 15th**_:_

> ___Pixel Perfect Complete_ is the final entry in the Pixel Perfect saga. It features remastered versions of the 13 original Pixel tracks, two all new tracks (and a remix) composed by myself, and a handful of remixes by various members of the VGM and indie music communities. It is my first full length, production ready album with over 20 tracks, ~70 minutes of music, and full color artwork designed by yours truly.

Only fifty physical copies of the album are available for pre-order for ten dollars, with digital copies available as wellÂ as a free (or pay-what-you-want) digital download upon release. [While you preview _Pixel Perfect CompleteÂ _on halc&#8217;s Bandcamp](http://halc.bandcamp.com/album/pixel-perfect-complete) (sounds amazing thus far!), we would urge you to definitely purchase a CD before they&#8217;re all gone!
