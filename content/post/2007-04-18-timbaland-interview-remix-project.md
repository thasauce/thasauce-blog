[17:24] <@zircon> Remix magazine interviewed Timbaland
  
[17:24] <@zircon> front page feature
  
[17:24] <@Ramaniscence> LOL
  
[17:24] <+Suzumebachi> fuck
  
[17:24] oh dear god
  
[17:25] <@Ramaniscence> Did that ask him about THE ISSUE?
  
[17:25] <+Suzumebachi> did they mention the fact that he&#8217;s a dirty thief?
  
[17:25] <@zircon> nope
  
[17:25] <+Suzumebachi> fucking terrible
  
[17:25] <@zircon> lots of ego pictures of him
  
[17:25] * +Suzumebachi loses respect for remix magazine
  
[17:25] <@zircon> like &#8220;I&#8217;m a genius producer&#8221;
  
[17:25] <@zircon> &#8220;no one appreciates Timbaland&#8217;s genius&#8221;
  
[17:25] <@zircon> &#8220;the #1 producer in hip hop&#8221;
  
[17:26] &#8220;omg u r teh awesum, wut r ur secruts?&#8221; type interview?
  
So Timbaland&#8217;s head is growing to gargantuan proportions of late&#8230;and people just keep feeding him. 

In an interview on the local morning show a month or so ago he had THIS to say:

&#8220;I read a lot of magazines say umm&#8230; timbaland a hip hop producer, i&#8217;m
  
like NO. wrong. i&#8217;m a music COMPOSER. like uhh, uhh, amadeus or
  
something. like a mozart. you see i&#8217;m just&#8230; one of the greats.&#8221;

I&#8217;m not kidding you, here&#8217;s the audio:

This has GOT to be one of the most ridiculous things I&#8217;ve ever heard,
  
especially on the heels of a controversy like this. I think it&#8217;s time
  
someone takes him down a peg.

WHICH is why I propose we have a remix contest. Remixing the above
  
provided quote. When it&#8217;s all said and done we can make an album out of
  
it =P.

Here are some of the contributions we&#8217;ve gotten already:
