The points system has been enabled. For a complete list, see the <a href="modules.php?name=FAQ&#038;myfaq=yes&#038;id_cat=8&#038;categories=Points" target="_self">FAQ section</a>Â on it. You can view how many points you have by going to &#8220;Your Account&#8221;. Users who accumulate certain amounts of points are automatically added to user groups, which in turn will unlock features on the site. How many points you need and what is unlocked you&#8217;ll have to find out for yourself.

<div>
  A note: Previously submitted content doesn&#8217;t count towards points, so if you&#8217;ve already contributed, continue doing so and you&#8217;ll begin to earn points.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Some things you can get points for:
  </p>
</div>



  * Submitting a news article that gets published: 1000 points
  * Commenting on a news story: 50 points*
  * Voting in a survey: 20 points

<div>
  *Note that spamming comments just to get points will result in a ban.
</div>

In the near future, we also hope to implement a &#8220;Rewards System&#8221; where you can cash in your points for special online features (like a custom user title on the forum), ThaSauce Merchandise (shirts and the like), and various other items as they become available.
