<a href="http://www.hellven.org/phpBB/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&#038;u=12" target="_self">Royal Sefton III</a>, frequently known as rs3 and a member of Hellven since
  
its second incarnation, released Hellven&#8217;s first solo album since the
  
netlabel&#8217;s return earlier this month. Featuring artwork by Kenji Bliss, <a target="_self" href="http://hellven.org/hlv01.html">&#8220;st rotfest and the death monastic&#8221;</a>
  
is a 10-track, nearly 25-minute techstep album whose darker
  
mood reflects a departure from much of Sefton&#8217;s previous work.
  
Originally released as a part of Ubik&#8217;s <a target="_self" href="http://als.ubikmusic.org/">Auld Lang Syne 2</a>
  
album &#8220;competition,&#8221; Sefton fully remastered his entry before
  
officially releasing the completed album at Hellven. The album&#8217;s
  
ever-present harmonies and no-pause/continuous format are described by
  
Sefton as one&#8217;s experience during the last half-hour before the
  
impending end of days.
