Okay, so maybe we&#8217;re not as on top of it as we&#8217;d like to believe. How we could miss hip-hop/electonic producer [A_Rival](http://blog.planetskill.com/)&#8216;s newest EP is beyond us. Just like channeling his magical Bay area powers by garnering an entire room full of people at three in the morning (_in an unannounced performance, by the way)Â _at MAGFest X, A_Rival really knows how to get the crowd pumped up. And pumped up we were when we gave _TMNT 2012_ a listen. The Â remixed &#8220;TMNT 2012&#8221; really highlights an eargasmic drum n&#8217; bass take on the original theme, while A_Rival&#8217;s sassy rhymes in &#8220;I Wanna Be a Ninja Turtle&#8221; make usÂ reminisceÂ about the times we really just wanted to tout purple eye bands and brazen weaponry.

We should probably be apologizing to A_Rival, since we didn&#8217;t know how awesomeÂ _TMNT 2012Â _would really be. But we&#8217;d like to think we&#8217;re making up for it by telling you that you can [download his latest EP on Bandcamp by naming your price](http://rivalrivalrival.bandcamp.com/album/tmnt-2012-ep). We&#8217;ve also included &#8220;I Wanna Be a Ninja Turtle&#8221; from theÂ _TMNT 2012 EPÂ _below.
