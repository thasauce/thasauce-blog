From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.traxinspace.com/">the front page</a>:

&#8220;_The team at Trax In Space is proud to announce we completed the private portion of our beta testing and the site is now officially open as a public beta. Check back often for new features and changes to the site._&#8221;
  
This is a good followup to my <a href="modules.php?name=NewsTwo&#038;file=article&#038;sid=657" target="_self">last news post</a>. Trax In Space 2 is the second iteration of one of the original &#8220;music community&#8221; sites like mp3.com or stationmp3.com were. However, Trax In Space&#8217;s community was largely demoscene/modscene based, allowing for users to upload their mod files to show to other people. It got so huge that the original site shut down because of astronomical hosting bills. But finally, it&#8217;s back, and similar to the first in terms of functionality and userbase. This time around, though, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.traxinspace.com/profile/overcoat">I have an account there</a>. As do <a target="_blank" href="http://www.traxinspace.com/userfriends/overcoat">some other people you may recognize in my friends list</a>.
