As some of you may know, I have been on RedHeat&#8217;s jock for a long time, hailing him as our generation&#8217;s Vangelis. &#8220;Kyria&#8221; is a song which I have been sharing with many people in #OCReMix and other channels in the community, and is quite an example of what I feel should be featured.
  
Born in 1979, RedHeat, or m0d as he is known on <a href="http://www.modarchive.com" target="_blank">The Mod Archive</a>, is quite an excellent musician, having built his own studio in his home in the Netherlands. While he is not a professional musician (his day job is a unix administrator), RedHeat manages to compose complex progressions that take the listener on a journey that, while sometimes a little indulgent, remain exciting and fresh. Kyria is an excellent example of RedHeat&#8217;s ability to work in a genre that is underappreciated, keeping true to stylistic nuances of New Age while making it his own.

While RedHeat himself is not a part of the VGM Arrangement community, he has ties with the tracking scene, from which many prominent VGMA artists have come.

that I respect m0d, and will NOT direct link to his music hosted on his
  
website).
