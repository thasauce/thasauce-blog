We&#8217;ve got the biggest news this month kiddies: according to the British
  
gaming magazine NGC, Capcom is working on a remake of the original
  
Resident Evil for the DS. The only details we have right now are that
  
the game will use the same camera perspective as Resident Evil 4 and
  
the touchscreen will be used for attacks.

Because this news is breaking, new details will most likely emerge soon. Check back here for the latest.
