Okay, so we might have a habit of hyping up NYC-based remixer and piano prodigy Sam Ascher-Weiss, also known by the moniker Shnabubula. But can you [blame](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/06/ign-releases-metroid-25th-anniversary-tribute-medley-video/) [us](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/06/utterly-insane-preview-for-shnabubulas-upcoming-album-game-genie/)? With over 1,200 subscribers and over 326,000 views on YouTube now, Shnabubula's reputation for piano improvisation and insane productivity still cannot be denied.

Even with his wonderful _[Free Play](http://shnabubula.bandcamp.com/album/free-play)_ album recently released (which you can preview all for free on [his Youtube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/Shnabubula#g/c/044363B462F539BE)),Â [Shnabubula](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/shnabubula/) has just put out a new teaser for yet another upcoming albumÂ to be released in March, featuringÂ music covers that will only utilize live piano and NES/Famicon samples. We are happy to report that if this teaser is a just sign of things to come, _NES JamzÂ _ will absolutely be off the hook. In this video, Mr. Ascher-Weiss really shows off his talent with some good ol&#8217;-fashioned _Double Dragon_. We seriously implore you to give this video a quick listen and see, truly, what the hype is all about.
