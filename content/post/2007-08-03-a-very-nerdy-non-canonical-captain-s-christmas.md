Description from the website:

_&#8220;You&#8217;ve waited more than 2 months for a new Captain S episode. Well, today is that day! When Santa Claus is kidnapped by the Game Genie, it&#8217;s up to Captain S to try and save Christmas. What he finds when he arrives in Video Land is an unexpected prisoner who turns out to be a tad ornery. However, it quickly becomes apparent that without the help of this Nerd, he may not be able to free Kris Kringle. Don&#8217;t miss the buddy flick of the summer, 4 months in the making!</p>
