Recently, JH Sounds released his brand new Genuine LP, here&#8217;s what he had to say about it.

> This album mostly came about due to my recent interest in making heavily sample-based music. In the past, my tracks were mostly synth-based and focused on compositional structure. Working with sampled material has been inspiring, and has led me into unexpected directions. The album download contains a 20-page booklet with samples credited.
