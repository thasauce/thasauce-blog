<span class="small">&#8220;Hello, VGMixers!</p> 

<p>
  &#8220;We have totally revamped the front page news display into an actual<br /> news system. You are now able to comment on updates, and quite a few<br /> users will be given the ability to post news articles to the front page<br /> (under the Admins&#8217; guidance, of course) &#8212; Turning this effectively<br /> into a pseudo-weblog. Expect to see such things as videogame concerts,<br /> events happening at other sites, gatherings of community members, and<br /> other cool happenings posted here [the VGMix news module].<br /> </span><br /> <span class="small"><br /> <br /> &#8220;I&#8217;m also taking this opportunity to announce the next big updates,<br /> which are close to completion (along with many, many small fixes): </p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Competition / collaborative project organization: We&#8217;ll be able to have<br /> compos and projects as an official, integrated part of the site, with<br /> voting and internal or external hosting all accounted for;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;User-based quality control: Let&#8217;s face it, we need to clean house.<br /> Songs extraordinary in either extreme are going to be tagged by<br /> consensus. There will be removals and there will be a panel-like<br /> function, and the full machinery of the &#8220;RPG system&#8221; is going to grind<br /> to life. Our aim is to avoid stepping on anyone&#8217;s toes or spiralling<br /> into cronyism and popularity wars. It&#8217;s going to be some exciting<br /> stuff.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Both things need more testing and fixing-up on my local machine,<br /> then I&#8217;ll open it up on our testing server for admins. Once they give<br /> the green light, both systems will go live &#8212; And there&#8217;s MUCH more to<br /> do after that, too!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Make sure to comment and tell us what you think, because it<br /> actually does matter. I want us to have a site that people want to use.&#8221;
