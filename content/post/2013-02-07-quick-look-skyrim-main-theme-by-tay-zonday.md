Zonday became famous on YouTube in 2007, when his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA" target="_blank">&#8220;Chocolate Rain&#8221; song</a> became one of the first viral videos on the site. He has also done covers of many other songs on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TayZonday/" target="_blank">his YouTube channel</a> (not all video game related, but still worth checking out!)
