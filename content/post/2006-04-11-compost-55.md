  CompoST 55 was held today. The theme was &#8220;Haunted House.&#8221; The entries are located at <a href="http://compost.lggaming.com/compost55/" target="_blank">http://compost.lggaming.com/compost55/</a>. Participating today was me, Tyler Heath, Catlein, Garian, and Fusion2004. Ty won, obviously :). GHETTOSTS!

  CompoSTs [short for Compo and SoundTempest put together :)] are thematic videogame music OHCs, held in #soundtempest on EsperNet. They are scheduled whenever anyone feels like compoing.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Formats allowed are music modules [it,s3m,xm,mod], NSF, mp3, and ogg.
  </p>

    I host the CompoSTs personally and also participate. I pick the theme and regulate the start and end time. I also decide whether the channel votes on a winner or not [sometimes when I am tired, there is no voting :)]

    Come hang out in #soundtempest, and please let me know if/when you would like to have one.
