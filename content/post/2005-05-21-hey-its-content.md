In the interest of moving the site forward, I&#8217;ve posted the first in a
  
weekly series of editorials called Tha Rant. You can get to it through
  
the <a target="_self" href="modules.php?name=Content">Editorials section</a>. This week&#8217;s column covers the PS3 controller.

<u>You</u> can contribute too! If you&#8217;re interested in writing a
  
regular column, please contact us. The topic can be just about anything
  
as long as it&#8217;s remotely scene-related, although we would like for it
  
to be at least (1) relevant, (2) current, and (3) appropriate, and you
  
need to be able to keep a regular schedule(i.e. weekly, monthly, etc.).
  
Contact <TheSauce2005@gmail.com> with the subject line &#8220;editorial&#8221; if interested.
