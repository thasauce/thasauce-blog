</center>This weekend marks the 25th anniversary of the 

_Metroid_ franchise. I spoke with Darren, founder of the _Metroid_ enthusiast website [Shinesparkers](http://www.shinesparkers.net/), about the fan arrangement album he directed titled [_Harmony of a Hunter_](http://shinesparkers.net/harmonyofahunter/). The release features thirty-six tracks covered by twenty-four artists paying tribute to the _Metroid_ series in a variety of genres.

Darren expressed his passion for the franchise and detailed his inspiration for taking on such an album project: â€œI noticed that Nintendo seemed quite focused on celebrating the 25th anniversary of _The Legend of Zelda_ franchise, and I felt that _Metroid_ was becoming overlooked. So I thought to myself that if Nintendo canâ€™t do anything to mark my favourite franchise, then I would. It turns out that I wasnâ€™t alone because a lot of people in the community wanted the anniversary to be marked and this is what gave me the determination to make this project work.â€ Darren also felt that music of the series was deserving of tribute, as he statesÂ  â€œ_Metroid_ has a great deal of memorable music that compliments the atmosphere that the series givesâ€.

The project began in December 2010 and involved a great deal of artists and other specialists in its creation. Darren spoke of how his communication skills came of use in directing the album, which he felt was an crucial component of directing the project: â€œIn my opinion, communication is the key element to ensuring a project like _Harmony of a Hunter_ works. I worked as closely as I could with people and offered suggestions and critique on certain tracks. I offered my thoughts where I felt they were needed but never pushed, demanded or limited the creative flow of the individual. If I did, the album would never have had the diverse range of talent that we have. I also feel that the project would have become more of a chore than a celebration. Asking for a track to be handed in by a certain date with no further communication just wouldnâ€™t work.â€

_Harmony of a Hunter_ carries a wide selection of styles and genres. Darren expressed his views on this eclecticism and the cohesiveness of the release as a whole: â€œI feel the diversity of the album was important because I wanted an album that would appeal to as many people as possible.â€ He commended Lee â€œ[The Orichalcon](http://ocremix.org/artist/4619/the-orichalcon)â€ Barberâ€™s mastering of the album under the circumstances, as he reveals that â€œLee has done a great job at blending some of these tracks into others which surprisingly, flow very well. Due to the nature of the project this was always going to be a tricky to master, but Lee has previous experience with mastering projects and I trust his judgment and his skills.â€

Darren reached out to the [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) community when he conceived the project: â€œI have always admired musicians such as [The Orichalcon](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/to/), [DarkeSword](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/darkesword/), [zircon](http://ocremix.org/artist/4628/zircon)â€¦ and in the early days of the project I wouldnâ€™t have even dreamed that they would have contributed to this. I am so very thankful that they did because their contributions have been excellent.â€ At one point, some discussion had taken place regarding possible endorsement as an official OC ReMix album; however due to Darrenâ€™s goal of releasing it on the _Metroid_ anniversary, this was not feasible.

_Harmony of a Hunter_ is [available now](http://www.shinesparkers.net/harmonyofahunter/download.html) at the Shinesparkers fan site, which features exclusive content related to the _Metroid_ franchise.
