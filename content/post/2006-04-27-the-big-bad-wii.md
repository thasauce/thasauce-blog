For the fun of it, and because Rama demands it (yeah, slave labor at its finest!), I&#8217;m bringing you an update to The Nintendo Revolution. If you&#8217;re a bit slow on the uptake, or just lazy, the announcement has been made, and it&#8217;s official. The Revolution has been given a name, and it is &#8220;Wii&#8221;.
  
Yeah, it&#8217;s bad, but what can we say? Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii</a> for more information, as well as <a target="_blank" href="http://revolution.nintendo.com/">http://revolution.nintendo.com/</a>.

Wii&#8230;yes, you say it like &#8220;we&#8221;. And yes, it rhymes with other words too.
