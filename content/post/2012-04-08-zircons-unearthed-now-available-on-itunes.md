Hitting third in Bandcamp&#8217;s top sellers recently,Â _Unearthed_ is definitely a force to be reckoned with. With astonishing sound and production quality that VGMÂ aficionadoÂ and sound designer [zircon](http://zirconmusic.com/) usually revels in, there&#8217;s no wonder that this newest release maintains the same absolutely breathtaking standards that he incorporates into all of his music. zircon describes the process in which Unearthed was also made available:

> The material on UNEARTHED was culled from a library of songs and instrumentals spanning from 2007 to 2012. I chose only the best unreleased material; though there are many more unreleased or non-album tracks, the ones on UNEARTHED are those that I really want to make available to the public and especially my loyal fans who have been waiting far too long for a new album. As a bonus, this 56+ minute album includes unreleased versions of tracks like &#8220;Warhead (Skrypnyk&#8217;s Deep 6 Mix)&#8221; and &#8220;Mindbender (Circular Breakdown Mix)&#8221;, both from Antigravity, and both featuring the remixing talents of other artists (Skrypnyk and Big Giant Circles, respectively).

Ranging from a variety of styles from dubstep to vocal trance,Â _UnearthedÂ _boasts having &#8220;something for every kind of electronic music fan&#8221;. We&#8217;re definitely inclined to agree. While zircon&#8217;s newest CD is [available on Bandcamp](http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/album/unearthed) for digital and physical copies, _Unearthed_ has also [been made available on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/unearthed/id516739283) for all you iTunes users out there!
