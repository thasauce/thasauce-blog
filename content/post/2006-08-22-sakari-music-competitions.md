Sakari has had a nice month and already some great entries for this month&#8217;s music competition. New names and old names are all in the hat this month!

  Hey to all you out there.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  I just wanted to let everyone know that Sakari has had more<br /> people submit entries this month for our monthly music competition than we&rsquo;ve had<br /> in past months. However, this still isn&rsquo;t a lot.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  So, if you&rsquo;ve got an interest in writing music, then I&rsquo;d<br /> <em>highly</em> recommend this competition because we&rsquo;ve gotten some nice entries in the<br /> past, and people that enter usually have a lot of fun. Well, that&rsquo;s usually<br /> because most of them are so damn competitive&#8230; But we&rsquo;d love to have more<br /> people join next month! Submission dates will be the 20<sup>th</sup> through<br /> the 26<sup>th</sup>, and the official theme, rules, options, and prizes will be<br /> announced on Sept. 1<sup>st</sup>.
</p>

  I&rsquo;ll give a small hint: Next month&rsquo;s theme will have<br /> something to do with The Matrix. And remember, it&#8217;s all in the Forums!
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Thanks and good luck to all who are currently participating<br /> in this month&rsquo;s competition, and make sure that you stop by and submit your<br /> entries for next month&rsquo;s competition!
