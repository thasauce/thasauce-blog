    I played drums on this short vgm tribute, and it was recorded a little<br /> over a year ago. With the band having broken up since, and this ep<br /> never having a &#8216;proper&#8217; release, I decided to put it up for download.<br /> It was very much rushed for release at magfest 5 (and never performed<br /> prior to recording), but having just listened to it again more recently<br /> I appreciate it more than when I first heard it. A bit rough around the<br /> edges, but not as bad as I recalled!

    Some of the track selection may be a bit on the esoteric side, hope you enjoy. </div>
