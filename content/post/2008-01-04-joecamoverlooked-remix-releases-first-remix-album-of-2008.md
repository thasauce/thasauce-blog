Straight from JoeCam, <a href="http://spelunker.olremix.org/" target="_blank">OverLooked ReMix has released the first remix album of 2008</a> featuring music from Spelunker.

    One of the shittiest games I can remember for the NES.

    Seriously, you died if you fell like half the length of the size of your character&#8217;s sprite. It was pretty asstastic.

    The music was pretty meh and repetitive as well, but the game has a name that is fun to say, so needless to say I felt it<br /> deserved to have an entire remix project devoted to it, but it&#8217;s not like it deserved a <a href="http://s3k.ocremix.org/">GOOD</a> remix project, so OLR was the place to go.

    Yes, the home of joke mixes and a whole bunch of people I never even heard of before. Seriously, what the hell is a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ttWdn3xdBW0">Richter</a> anyways?
