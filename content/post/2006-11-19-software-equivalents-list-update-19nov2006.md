For those who&#8217;re interested, I recently updated the software equivalents list on my homepage. I added a handful of new emulations, alternatives and changed some additional info.

You can find that list from a direct link on my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.studio-compyfox.de">studio page</a>. I also recommend you to keep an eye on my blog, as I&#8217;ll soon release some very interesting news and material there.
