<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Shael_Riley">Shael</a> has <a target="_blank" href="http://shaelbopp.livejournal.com/501679.html">recently announced on his LiveJournal</a> that he has recently finished the cases for his sale of his original album, <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Toybox">Toybox</a>, released at the end of last year. The album will be availible for purchase, from <a target="_self" href="http://www.ShaelRiley.com">ShaelRiley.com</a>, around March at the EARLIEST and will featured remastered version of the songs, which will remain free for download. 

&#8220;_Anyway, I&#8217;m only selling the CDs at
  
Shaelriley.com, and I won&#8217;t begin selling them until March at the
  
earliest. CDs will contain completely remastered tracks of
  
signifigantly higher quality than the MP3s, which will remain freely
  
downloadable from the site._&#8220;
