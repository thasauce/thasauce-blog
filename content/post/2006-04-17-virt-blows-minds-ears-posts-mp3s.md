On March 31st, <a href="http://virt.vgmix.com/" target="_blank">Jake Kaufman</a> (better known as virt), had a successful live chip show in New York City. He was preceeded by <a href="http://www.onebitmusic.com/" target="_blank">One Bit Music</a> and <a href="http://www.bitshifter.cc/" target="_self">Bit Shifter</a>. One Bit Music played the drums live during his set, and then Bit Shifter literally blew the speakers, leaving Jake without tweeters.
  
As a bonus, Jake is offering the majority of the songs he played for download from his personal website, <a href="http://virt.vgmix.com/" target="_blank">http://virt.vgmix.com</a>. I highly recommend the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_%28song%29" target="_blank">Thriller</a>&#8220; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_%28song%29" target="_blank"></a>cover. Cheers.
