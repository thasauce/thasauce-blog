This just in from The Megas, they&#8217;re heading toward the Northeastern United States on tour in the near future. Here&#8217;s a quote from their MySpace bulletin about the tour:

<div class="quoted-text">
  &#8220;Hey guys &#8211;<br /> our Northeastern US tour is just 2 months away, and we need to start<br /> locking down some shows around 32 Bit Genocide! We&#8217;ll be starting in<br /> Baltimore on August 16th and working our way north, depending on where<br /> the shows come through.
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  If you<br /> have any suggestions or contacts at venues, please let us know ASAP!<br /> We&#8217;re also down to play a few house parties or barbecues, especially<br /> midweek (it is summertime, after all!) So if you&#8217;d like to put<br /> something together, please let us know.</p> 
  
  <p>
    We&#8217;re<br /> also looking to play at arcades and video game stores, so if anyone can<br /> give us some leads in that area, make with the info!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Many of you have asked us to play your hometowns&#8230; this is your opportunity to help make that happen!
