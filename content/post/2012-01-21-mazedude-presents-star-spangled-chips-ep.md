You may recall a [previous post](http://thasauce.net/2011/07/25/mazedude-announces-pre-order-ep-talks-about-his-anticipated-album/) that about [Chris &#8220;Mazedude&#8221; Getman](http://mazedudemusic.com/)&#8216;s astonishing bonus EPÂ _Star-Spangled Chips_Â last year. You may also recall that Mazedude&#8217;s EP was _only_ available to those who who pre-ordered his upcoming album which honors **two discs worth** of timeless American composers and arrangements from popular titles such as _Bioshock_, _Dante&#8217;s Inferno_, _Super Meat Boy_, _Civilization IV_, _Diablo_, and much more.

Although _[American Pixels](http://www.americanpixels.com/index.php)_ is not slated to come out until later this year,Â Mazedude has just released the more-than-outstanding _Star Spangled Chips EP_ on [his Bandcamp page](http://mazedude.bandcamp.com/). This is probably a winning choice for those who want to preview Mr. Getman&#8217;s incredibly enterprising talents as both a musician and composer. We cannot stress enough how stoked we are for the future Mazedude release &#8212; [pr](http://mazedude.bandcamp.com/album/star-spangled-chips)[eview _Star Spangled Chips_ here](http://mazedude.bandcamp.com/album/star-spangled-chips) if you dare.
