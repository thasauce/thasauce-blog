This week&#8217;s round of <a target="_self" href="http://www.songoftheweek.info/">Song of the Week</a>
  
was one of the closest of recent history. All of the tracks were
  
excellent, and as a result the top two tracks tied in total points (a
  
tiebreaker was necessary) and the next five tracks were separated by a
  
total of five points.

For those who don&#8217;t know, Song of the Week is a friendly competition
  
designed to showcase more obscure music. Anyone can submit a track (new
  
nominators&#8217; tracks are automatically considered in the upcoming week),
  
and the top eight tracks in the queue are selected each week to be
  
voted upon by anyone who wants to pick his/her favorites.
  
In third place was &#8220;<a target="_self" href="http://www.songoftheweek.info/music/week0023/Genso%20Suikoden%20III%20Music%20Collection%20%7ERustling%20of%20the%20Wind%7E%20-%20Koroku%27s%20Theme.mp3">Koroku&#8217;s Theme</a>&#8221; from Genso Suikoden III Music
  
Collection ~Rustling of the Wind~, a jazzy arrangement of the original
  
theme. Relaxing saxophone lines and smooth percussion combine to form a
  
mellow, laid-back vibe.

The second place track was &#8220;<a target="_self" href="http://www.songoftheweek.info/music/week0023/Tengai%20Makyo%20II%20Manjimaru%20Original%20Soundtrack%20-%20L%20Map%20%28General%29.mp3">L Map (General)</a>&#8221; from Tengai
  
Makyo II Manjimaru Original Soundtrack, originally composed by the
  
noted Japanese film composer Joe Hisaishi. Its lighthearted orchestral fare
  
won the hearts of this week&#8217;s voters.

This week&#8217;s overall winner was &#8220;<a target="_self" href="http://www.songoftheweek.info/music/week0023/The%20Sims%202%20%28PC%20Game%20Rip%29%20-%20Pop%20Station%20-%20Track%204.mp3">Pop Station &#8211; Track 4</a>&#8221; from The
  
Sims 2. It has relatively simple guitar, string, synth, and percussion
  
lines, but they&#8217;re flipped and switched throughout the piece to give a
  
flowing groove that doesn&#8217;t get boring.
