Established by the creators of the leading independent video game editorial siteÂ <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IndieGames.com</a>Â and online download serviceÂ <a href="http://www.desura.com/" rel="nofollow">Desura</a>, indie game bundle websiteÂ <a href="http://www.indieroyale.com/" rel="nofollow">Indie Royale</a>Â releases game bundles every two weeks to help get the word out over games that are worth playing and support developers that are typically passed over in mainstream media.

With cap and tassel tosses fast approaching, the folks behind Indie Royale have recently released the **Graduation Bundle** for the sake of all you graduates out there (congrats, by the way), with awesome indie releases like [The Void](http://www.tension-game.com/), [Dead Pixels](http://deadpixelsthegame.com/), [The Ship](http://blazinggriffin.com/theship/), [1000 Amps,](http://www.theoddmanout.net/1000amps/) [LaserCat](http://www.monsterjail.com/), and [AirMech](https://www.carbongames.com/chrome.html).Â In addition to all these awesome games that you get for various platforms, you'll receive even more bonuses for just a $7 minimum donation â€”Â Â Cheap Dinosaurs&#8217; acclaimedÂ <a href="http://store.datagarden.org/album/cheap-dinosaurs" target="_blank">self-titled chiptune-rock</a>[Â album](http://store.datagarden.org/album/cheap-dinosaurs) is yours for the taking.

The [Cheap Dinosaurs S/T](http://store.datagarden.org/album/cheap-dinosaurs) soundsÂ Â promising, as the project is explained byÂ low-bit composer Dino Lionetti when he states, &#8220;Composed on a Nintendo gameboy rigged with a sequencing cartridge, the album expertly moves from jazzy bit-scapes to algorithmic grooves that are equally suited for adventure, research- and romance. The suite of nine songs are at once challenging and rewarding, propelling Cheap Dinosaurs own brand of chip-music to the forefront of experimental pop.&#8221;
