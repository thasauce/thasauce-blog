Lots of them, lately! <a href="http://compost.lggaming.com/compost59/" target="_blank">http://compost.lggaming.com/compost59/</a>

  The theme was &#8220;Clock Tower&#8221; and the entrants were myself, Ty, BlueMoose [Ty&#8217;s sister], and Xerol. Personally I thought Ty&#8217;s was the neatest one, and also the most unique. I tried to rip off Castlevania with the symphonic rock, failed terribly. Xerol&#8217;s sounded like Castlevania also, but like some of the more mellow tracks. BlueMoose&#8217;s didn&#8217;t have much to it, though she did incorporate bells, like I SHOULD HAVE, BUT DIDN&#8217;T :(((

    Also, I thought, to make the news posts more interesting, I&#8217;d say something about each song.</div>
