  Joshua Morse tends to induce on us lowly humans who are only capable of discerning
  what good VGM music is while tirelessly mining for ore and crafting cool new blocks
  that make our castles that much better.

Here at ThaSauce, we&#8217;ve been fans of creating and destroying decadent pixellated block worlds since 2009. But we&#8217;re even bigger fans of the aural pleasures that Joshua Morse tends to induce on us lowly humans who are only capable of discerning what good VGM music is while tirelessly mining for ore and crafting cool new blocks that make our castles _that much better_.

To celebrate [Joshua Morse&#8217;s latest album _Waveform 3_, to be released on April 24th](http://thasauce.net/2012/04/13/joshua-morses-waveform-3-to-be-released/), we have included a lovely arrangement from the indie sandbox phenomenonÂ _Minecraft_ that has sweeped the world by storm one block at a time. Morse&#8217;s take on C418&#8217;s original&#8221;Subwoofer Lullaby&#8221; tends to inspire a more upbeat mood of relaxation and tranquility, yet maintains further dramatic interpretation at 1:33 of the serenity that C418 tends to stick with throughout. Overall, very much an enjoyable adaptation of one of _Minecraft_&#8216;s more sought-after tracks.
