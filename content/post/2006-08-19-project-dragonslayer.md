Project Dragonslayer is a collaborated project based on the game Dragon Slayer IV, also known as Legacy of the Wizard. As this game features an amazing soundtrack full of composition and style, it deserves to be recognized and modernized.

The first steps are being taken and the recruitment has begun. The
  
project leader is not only stopping at ThaSauce and OverClocked
  
Remix, but also calling other remixers on. This is not only to broaden
  
the possibilities, but also to bring remixers of different natures and
  
interests together.
