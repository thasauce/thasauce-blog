Holy mackerel ! Finally what alot of us have been waiting for..

From <a href="http://www.1up.com/" target="_self">1up.com</a>:

Hot on the heels of the **Kingdom Hearts II** voice cast, which was [announced just last week](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147824), comes the first peek at the English-language voice cast of [Final Fantasy VII Advent Children](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147663&did=1), which has been delayed repeatedly due to some last minute signings, most notably that of **American Beauty** jailbait, Mena Suvari, who was brought on to perform the voice of Aerith Gainsborough in not only Kingdom Hearts II, but also to reprise the role in Advent Children.

<div>
  While Sony&#8217;s <a href="http://1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147962#" target="_blank">DVD</a> head of marketing, Mike Stratford, was quoted talking all kinds of crap to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147663&#038;did=1">The Digital Bits</a>, claiming that we&#8217;d see the release of Advent Children in North America by &#8220;end of 2006&#8221; (causing much consternation among <a href="http://1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147962#" target="_blank">Final Fantasy</a> fans nationwide), 1UP is glad to inform you that the DVD and UMD will ship in the U.S. on April 25, 2006. So in case you haven&#8217;t already downloaded the movie from the Internet (bad, pirates, bad!) and are looking forward to seeing this hour-and-a-half slice of CG Final Fantasy fan-service for yourself, you&#8217;ve roughly two months to go. Here&#8217;s the mostly anonymous voice cast, with the exception of Rachel Leigh Cook (Tifa), and Mena Suvari (Aerith), with Steve Burton playing the role of Cloud Strife (he was the voice of Cloud in Kingdom Hearts 1). But who cares about that when it can finally be revealed that &#8220;Girl&#8221; will be played by Andrea Bowen?</p>
