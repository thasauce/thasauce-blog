First OverClocked ReMix was down because complications with ZTNet, and now DJP has decided to move off of ZTNet all together to avoid such problems in the future&#8230;
  
[19 August 20:29:47] zircon: ztnet has been the host of OCR for awhile     
[19 August 20:30:04] zircon: but they&#8217;ve been a disappointment overall, and dave has been thinking about moving it to a new server and administrating the site himself     
[19 August 20:30:13] zircon: previously, the ztnet guys (all two of them) had the ultimate access     
[19 August 20:30:18] zircon: dave couldnt do anything about some issues     
[19 August 20:30:20] zircon: but      
[19 August 20:30:25] zircon: the site is going to be migrated to new servers     
[19 August 20:30:27] zircon: hopefully between 48 hours     
[19 August 20:30:32] zircon: dedicated one     
[19 August 20:30:37] zircon: so that dave can have full control     
[19 August 20:30:40] zircon: over shit like this     
[19 August 20:30:45] zircon: the forums have to be backed up though     
[19 August 20:30:54] zircon: and then the new server has to be configured     
[19 August 20:31:19] zircon: so     
[19 August 20:31:22] zircon: no, we&#8217;re not being attacked     
[19 August 20:31:24] zircon: we didn&#8217;t get sued     
[19 August 20:31:28] zircon: it&#8217;s just backend stuff ðŸ˜›
