[VGM: Very Good Music](http://128.175.29.66:8000/listen.pls), my weekly video game music radio show, airs TONIGHT at 10PM EST. This week, I round out the top tracks from &#8217;08 from all over the internet (and beyond!). Cohosts are sure to be present in some form or another, so tune in to find out who&#8217;s harassing me this week. Make sure to join [#vgm on EnterTheGame](irc://irc.enterthegame.com/vgm) to chat with other listeners too.
  
VGM: Very Good Music features video game remixes, tracks from game OSTs, and even original
  
non-vg tracks from composers and remixers. Whether it&#8217;s showcasing new releases, dusting off the oldies (HA!), or playing popular requests, you&#8217;re sure to get tracks from a variety of websites, games, remixers, and genres. Come hang out with me this
  
and every Friday night with VGM: Very Good Music!
