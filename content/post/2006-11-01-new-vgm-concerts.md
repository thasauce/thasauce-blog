A concert series named &#8216;Passion&#8217; will be playing December in Sydney, Melbourne, and Singapore. They&#8217;ll be in Melbourne on the 9th and in Sydney on the 12th. Yasunori Mitsuda will be attending and performing. He&#8217;ll also tentatively be selling CDs of his work and providing autorgraphs. Hitoshi Sakimoto (composer of recent Final Fantasy games) will be there as well. All the details and ticket information can be found at [Eminence Online](http://www.eminenceonline.com/passion/). Let me know if you&#8217;re going, since I&#8217;d love to get pictures for the Chrono Compendium.
