    <a href="http://faefly-records.co.uk/helentrevillion/" target="_blank">Helen Trevillion has a new site design and a new location</a>.<br /> Her site still has the old videogame remixes most of you know and love<br /> her for&#8230; except Angel&#8217;s Dear. But I don&#8217;t really want that up on her<br /> site anyway, it&#8217;s old and bad ðŸ˜› The site now features a &#8220;watch&#8221;<br /> section where you can view some videos featuring her music. Please<br /> download everything on her site because she is a fantastic composer who<br /> makes beautiful music. Also, this is totally not something I say often,<br /> but<em> buy her CD.</em> You will like it.

    <p>
      Wassup maing? Seeing as the free music thread died, & you have<br /> a new column out, I thought I&#8217;d shoot you a pm to let you know about a<br /> new album being released&#8230; probably when you get this, by this guy I<br /> barely found out about. Here&#8217;s the myspace link</em>

        It has some clips of the music, & it should have the link to the album, FLAC even, today.

        Electro SID by aegis and zabutom. It&#8217;s&#8230; well&#8230; European sounding ðŸ˜€ Get XMPlay and the .sid plugin [best] or <a target="_blank" href="http://chipamp.org/">ChipAmp</a> for WinAmp to play this file.

This 14 minute electronic/orchestral piece is very progressive and very technical. He would also like to specify that &#8220;there are some sample-based instruments in the song: the bass, the drums, the guitar, the hand percussions, the xilophone and the arpsynth are not made using VST technology.&#8221; And that&#8217;s the power of schlongs. Er, Renoise.
