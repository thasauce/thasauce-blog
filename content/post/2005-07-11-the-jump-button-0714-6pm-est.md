With
  
all the comic book movies and remakes coming out lately, we just can&#8217;t
  
avoid this topic. Call in this week to suggest a movie based on almost
  
anything. Suggest a book, movie, tv show, song, website, comic, game,
  
&#8230;anything. We&#8217;ll also be running down the latest info on upcoming
  
adaptations like Doom, Eva, Superman, and more. And, we&#8217;ll be
  
discussing some of the really good (and really bad) &#8220;based-on&#8221; movies
  
that have been made.
  
**Start Time**: 18:00
  
**Ending Time**: 21:00
