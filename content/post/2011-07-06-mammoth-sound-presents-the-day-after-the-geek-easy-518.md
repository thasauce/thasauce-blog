Attention Nerdapalooza fans! If you're still in Orlando after [one of the biggest festival events of the year](http://nerdapalooza.org/), come get your nerd on at [The Geek Easy](http://www.mygeekeasy.com/) on July 18th for a special night of exciting new acts and spectacular encores. With lively performances from nerdcore legends including [YTCracker](http://www.ytcracker.com/v2011/), [Mega Ran](http://megaran.com/), and [Shael Riley](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/shael-riley/), this insane line-up will definitely blow your mind and leave you wanting more. A special after-show performance is also scheduled to follow from none other than the [SKILL FOCUS: BURLESQUE](https://www.facebook.com/skillfocusburlesque), Orlando&#8217;s exclusive nerdy burlesque troupe!

For more information on Mammoth Sound Presents: &#8220;The Day After&#8230;&#8221;, click [here](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=251344084880210).

Remember to bring your friends, frenemies, lovers, and cute dogs. Well, maybe not cute dogs. Unless you have a Corgiâ€¦
