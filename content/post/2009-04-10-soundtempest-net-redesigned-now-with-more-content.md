Music industry newsblog and artist help resource <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundtempest.net/">SoundTempest</a> has been completely overhauled and redesigned by OCR forum member and pro web guy Cyan_Ide (aka Chad Behnke of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.steampowereddesign.com/">Steam Powered Design</a>). The new site features an improved RSS feed as well as Digg, StumbleUpon and Twitter integration with every post and guide, better organized post tags/categories, and a non-default WordPress graphical theme.

Besides functional improvement, SoundTempest&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundtempest.net/guides/">Guides section</a> has also been revamped. These guides, written by zircon (Andrew Aversa) cover a variety of music industry topics such as music licensing, distributing and selling a CD, online collaboration and purchasing a DAW computer. With the new iteration of SoundTempest, all guides have been converted to lean, downloadable PDF files that are readily printable and feature easier to read text and formatting.
