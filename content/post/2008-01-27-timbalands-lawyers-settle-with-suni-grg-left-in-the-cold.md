I was over on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.remix64.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=4922&#038;st=0">remix64&#8217;s forums</a> when I caught a nice little nugget from forum administrator Chris Abbott. Apparently Timbaland&#8217;s record company has settled with Janne Suni&#8217;s lawyers. <a href="http://www.fairlight.fi/tempest/acidjazzed_evening/" target="_blank">Suni&#8217;s website</a> confirms his case has come to a close.

<div class="quoted-text">
  Timabaland&#8217;s record company settled with that Finnish individual, and<br /> now both parties are trying to avoid giving GRG any recognition, credit<br /> or share.
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  It&#8217;s official with Suni. Court action is still proceeding for GRG&#8217;s<br /> case. I know lawyers are lawyers, but the morally correct thing to have<br /> done was to join forces with GRG and get joint lawyers. </p>

Recap of the initial events:

<div class="quoted-text">
  In early 2007, Timbaland was accused of plagiarism regarding his work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Furtado" title="Nelly Furtado">Nelly Furtado</a><br /> track &#8220;Do It&#8221;. He is alleged to have plagiarized several elements (both<br /> motifs and samples) in the song without giving credit or compensation.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-Rolling_Stone" title="">[14]</a></sup><br /> The alleged original track, titled &#8220;Acidjazzed Evening&#8221;, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune" title="Chiptune">chiptune</a>-style 4-channel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" title="Amiga">Amiga</a> module composed by Finnish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscener" title="Demoscener">demoscener</a> Janne Suni (a.k.a. Tempest). The song won first place in the Oldskool Music competition at Assembly 2000, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoparty" title="Demoparty">demoparty</a> held in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki%2C_Finland" title="Helsinki, Finland">Helsinki, Finland</a> held in the year 2000. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene.org" title="Scene.org">Scene.org</a>,<br /> the song was uploaded to their servers the same year, long before the<br /> release of the song by Furtado. The song was later remixed (with Suni&rsquo;s<br /> permission) by Norwegian Glenn Rune Gallefoss (a.k.a. GRG) for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_SID" title="MOS Technology SID">SID format</a><br /> &#8211; this is the version which was later allegedly sampled for &#8220;Do It&#8221;. It<br /> was added to the High Voltage SID Collection on December 21, 2002.<br /> A video which claims to show proof of the theft was posted to YouTube on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_12" title="January 12">January 12</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007" title="2007">2007</a>.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup> Another video was posted to YouTube on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_14" title="January 14">January 14</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007" title="2007">2007</a>,<br /> claiming Timbaland also stole the tune a year earlier for the ringtone<br /> &#8220;Block Party&#8221;, one of several that were sold in the United States in<br /> 2005. A YouTube video comparing all the related songs was posted on<br /> February 13.</p>

Since Timbaland has been accused of directly ripping off GRG&#8217;s cover of a song Suni composed back in 2000, many NEW rips have come to up as well:

From <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#Plagiarism_controversy">Wikipedia:</a>

<div class="quoted-text">
  Another song in Nelly Furtado&#8217;s album <em>Loose</em> has the same<br /> allegations as &#8216;Do It&#8217;. &#8216;Wait for You&#8217; is told to be plagiarized from a<br /> Turkish folk music song &#8216;Allah Allah Desem Gelsem&#8217; by Muhlis Akarsu,<br /> famous folk music singer. It is believed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%9Flama" title="Ba&#287;lama">Ba&#287;lama</a><br /> (a kind of traditional instrument) sample is used in Nelly&#8217;s song by<br /> Timbaland illegaly. A video comparing the two songs was posted on<br /> Youtube. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-14" title="">[17]</a></p> 
  
  <p>
    The owner of the record group of Muhlis Akarsu has referred to IFPI about the issue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, there are several other songs where it is believed that<br /> Timbaland has illegally sampled from them. A video posted on Youtube<br /> claims to show proof that Jay-Z&#8217;s song <em>Big Pimpin</em> has stolen samples from Abdel Halim Hafez&#8217;s song <em>&#8220;Khosara&#8221;</em> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah" title="Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>&#8216;s songs &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Know What To Tell Ya&#8221; and &#8220;More Than A Woman&#8221; have the whole background from Warda&#8217;s <em>Batwanness Bik</em> and Mayada El Hennawi&#8217;s <em>Alouli Ensa</em> respectively.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-15" title="">[18]</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another posted video shows similarities between Utada Hikaru&#8217;s <em>Exodus &rsquo;04</em> and Aitha Al Menhali&#8217;s <em>Meshkeltek</em>.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-16" title="">[19]</a></sup>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yet another video shows how similar are the songs Ne-Yo and Fabulous&#8217; <em>Makes Me Better</em> and Sherine&#8217;s <em>Aal Saaban Aleh</em>.<br /> The common point of these videos is that Timbaland took big parts of<br /> the songs without making big alterations and without giving credit to<br /> the artists.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland#_note-17" title="">[20]</a> </div>
