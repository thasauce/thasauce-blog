It&rsquo;s always been a<br /> more of a gallery than a business site. Terrible for trying to attract<br /> clients. Under &ldquo;Demo Reel&rdquo; I have junk that&rsquo;s like 4 years old. There<br /> are 400-something songs laying around randomly, most of which contain<br /> cocker spaniel samples.

  &#8220;So, after years of coming up with reasons why I&rsquo;m not ready to &ldquo;promote myself&rdquo; yet, I rainbow-wanked <a href="http://jake.vgmix.com/" title="my new site!" target="_blank">jake.vgmix.com</a><br /> into existence. I&rsquo;m damn well ready now. So tell all your buddies who<br /> work for high-powered game studios to go check out and get their<br /> bosses to hire me. God knows I&rsquo;m going to be knocking down their doors<br /> either way.<br />&#8220;But don&rsquo;t say goodbye to my NES turntable just yet, virt.vgmix will<br /> continue to be my personal home, so keep checking here for all your<br /> inane virt rantings and new tunes.<br />&#8220;Oh, and by the way, <a href="http://blipfestival.org/" title="BLIPFEST 06" target="_blank">Blip Festival</a>.<br /> Basically, it&rsquo;s Chiptune Woodstock, in NYC. If you don&rsquo;t come, you&rsquo;re<br /> in big, big trouble and I&rsquo;m going to laugh at you forever.&#8221;
