So I had this idea a while back for a musical version of the party game &#8220;Telephone&#8221;. The first round of this game has started: <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=91247" target="_blank">http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=91247</a>.
  
Signups are still open until we get near the end of the list, since it&#8217;ll take us a while to get down that far, but I don&#8217;t want to really exclude anyone immediately. Depending on how terrible this ends up, we might do a second round after it&#8217;s over.
