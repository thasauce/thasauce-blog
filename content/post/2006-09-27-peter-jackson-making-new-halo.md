No&#8230;not the movie. A new Halo GAME. Yea, I WTF&#8217;d too. That, of course, has no bearing on how good or bad the game&#8217;ll be, of course, but it WON&#8217;T be Halo 3 _nor_ the upcoming Halo RTS that&#8217;s being made by Ensemble Studios (of Age of Empires fame). 

These are just a FEW of the announcements made at Microsoft&#8217;s keynote @ X06.

Microsoft is pulling out all the stops in its [X06 Keynote today in Barcelona](http://lukems.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=7492444&publicUserId=5519593). The announcements are flying fast and furious: [Ensemble studios is making a Halo RTS](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154046), and [Peter Jackson is making a new Halo game](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/27/peter-jackson-and-fran-walsh-to-make-new-halo-game-original-ip/) (unrelated to Halo 3 or the RTS). The [HD-DVD will be $200 in the U.S.](http://kotaku.com/gaming/hd+dvd/360-hddvd-for-200-in-us-203646.php) with a release aimed at November of this year. They&#8217;ve got a good deal of 360 exclusive content including [the next Splinter Cell and GTA IV Episodes](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/27/splinter-cell-bioshock-gta-iv-episodes-are-console-exclusive-f/), and (initially) [Bioshock](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/bioshock/bioshock-no-longer-coming-to-ps3-at-launch-203638.php).
  
Bioshock will also be on Windows, of course. Windows is also the
  
platform on which Microsoft is announcing a new Massively Multiplayer
  
game from Cryptic Studios, a new super-hero MMOG based on Marvel
  
Comics&#8217; IP: [Marvel Universe Online](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154045)._
