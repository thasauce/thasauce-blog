**blacking out this Wednesday, January 18th**Â from 8 am-8 pm EST. No, we do not think that ThaSauce receives millions of views per day, but that does not stop us from trying to raise awareness around the possible debilitating implications of the InternetÂ _if_ the Senate&#8217;s Protect IP Act or the House&#8217;s Stop Online Piracy Act come to pass. Over fifty different websites that many of us utilize daily will also black out on January 18th, including such sites as [Wikipedia](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/wikipedia-blackout-coming-jan-18-says-co-founder-jimmy-wales/2012/01/16/gIQAh2Ke3P_blog.html)Â andÂ [Reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html)Â to date. Other projects that have joined in solidarity also include [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/sopa/),Â [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/help-stop-sopa-pipa/), and [Minecraft](http://www.gamebandits.com/news/minecraft-even-copyright-owners-are-against-sopa-29750/). Our staff at ThaSauce cannot stress the importance of action: if we do nothing, the complete censorship of the Internet will be inevitable.

You can learn more about the Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act [here](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3261/show) and [here](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/show). There is also an available list of [companies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjisu18X6s7lPtAsIQg5Ol3KJjymPT2az1kasQVwGiw/preview?pli=1&sle=true&pli=1) and [websites](http://nlb-creations.com/2012/01/13/websites-confirmed-for-the-jan-18-blackout-protesting-sopa/) that have shown support against PIPA and SOPA. To keep informed, you can watch [a live video stream of the House hearing where multiple people from the community will be testifying SOPA/PIPA on January 18th](http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1553:issa-announces-oversight-hearing-on-dns-a-search-engine-blocking&catid=22:releasesstatements). Please help us raise awareness against this despicable attempt of Internet censorship and [take action](http://americancensorship.org/).
