From <a href="http://gamemusic4all.blogspot.com/2009/07/weezer-8-bit-album-compilation-release.html" target="_blank">GM4A</a>: 

> For most folks growing up with the NES, SNES, gameboy, and other classic consoles of the current chiptune era, another staple in our lives was good old 90&#8217;s rock. One such band was the ever amazing and often nerdy Weezer. In this vein, Pterodactyl Squad has organized, and finally released [Weezer &#8211; The 8 bit Album compilation](http://www.ptesquad.com/more/pte018.html)&#8230;

> &#8230;which as the title states, is an album &#8220;created using original videogame hardware running home-brew software, and vary radically in style, from minimal &#8216;one man and his Game Boy&#8217; compositions to 8-bit inspired full band performances.&#8221;. The album is 14 covers by no less than the finest in chiptune music today.
> 
> I along with many others have been really looking forward to this tribute album, and very excited to have it released. The album is great even if you aren&#8217;t familiar with every Weezer song on the album, or if you don&#8217;t recognize the chippy artists paying tribute to them! As with all Pterodactyl Squad releases the album is free to download, so head to [ptesquad.com](http://www.ptesquad.com/) right now and check it out!
