I was pokin&#8217; around over at [AudioScrobbler/LastFM](http://www.last.fm) when I realized [my artist profile](http://www.last.fm/music/sgtRama) didn&#8217;t have any images for it. I uploaded a few, but the images need at least 10 unanimous yes votes or a 75% majority before they become &#8220;official&#8221;.

Afterward, I decided to check and see if any OTHER mixers had images. I found that [only DJP](http://www.last.fm/music/djpretzel) had an image for his profile. I think other mixers in the community should go post their images and people should vote them in =.

You can find a LOT of mixers just by checking LastFMs &#8220;tag&#8221; system, at links like these:
