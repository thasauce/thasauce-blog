Time to add another person to the list of OCR community members going pro!! Our very own judge, remixer, and event coordinator <a target="_blank" href="http://ocremix.org/remixer/pixietricks/">pixietricks</a> (Jill Goldin) is slated to sing on the soundtrack of the **Civilization IV expansion pack**,
  
&#8220;Beyond the Sword&#8221;. Jill was one of only two sopranos to be selected
  
for this gig. The composer, Christopher Tin, took home two awards at
  
Game Developers Conference, including &#8220;Best Original Choral
  
Composition&#8221; awarded by the Game Audio Network Guild &#8211; in other words,
  
this guy set the talent bar pretty high!
  
Civ IV itself has won virtually every award imaginable such as &#8220;Best
  
Strategy Game&#8221; and &#8220;Game of the Year&#8221; from a host of different websites
  
and publications, making it one of the most high-profile PC games
  
around. No doubt the expansion will receive as much critical acclaim.

Congratulations, Jill! Today, Civ IV, tomorrow, Final Fantasy XIII? <img border="0" class="inlineimg" title="Cool" alt="" src="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" />
