<a href="http://olremix.org" target="_self">OLR</a> just posted its <a href="http://olremix.org/remixes/?id=500" target="_self">500th song</a>. Clearly, if you have not heard <a href="http://olremix.org/remixes/" target="_self">all 500</a>, you are missing out on an exciting headache and waste of an entire day.
  
Well, the id on it is 500, but I&#8217;m pretty sure there are less than 500, due to removals and stupidity. Boing!
