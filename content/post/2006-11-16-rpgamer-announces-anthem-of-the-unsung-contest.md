In this week&#8217;s RPGamer.com Sound Test update, Matthew Foster
  
(Redbeastmage) announced the launch of &#8216;Anthem of the Unsung&#8217;, the
  
site&#8217;s first music related competition in a year. Contestants are
  
expected to create remixes of lesser known character themes in order to
  
compete for a first place prize of an RPG soundtrack worth $40.
  
In his own words, here&#8217;s the basic scope on what is expected of the source material choice for this competition.

_&#8216;For a common example, doing say, Terra&#8217;s theme from Final Fantasy VI
  
would recieve a 0 for the contest, as she is argueably the main
  
character of the game. However, doing a piece that is based on Gogo&#8217;s
  
theme, from the same game, would be more fitting. Keep in mind, that
  
the character on whom the music is based doesn&#8217;t need to be a hero or
  
playable character. Villians, NPCs, even multiple related characters
  
are fair game. Basically anyone with a musical theme attached to them
  
will work out.&#8217;</p> 

</em>The deadline for submissions is December 14th at 11:59PM PST, with
  
the results to be announced on Christmas Eve. For the contest rules and
