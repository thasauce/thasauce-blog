<a href="http://www.olremix.org" target="_blank">OverLooked ReMiX</a>
  
celebrates its 100th ReMiX tonight, Sure, we haven&#8217;t been around long,
  
and sure, we suck, but 100 mixes in just a few months is not bad, eh?.
  
The <a target="_self" href="http://www.olremix.org/remixes/?id=100">100th mix</a>
  
is pretty incredible, featuring clever lyrics about OverLooked,
  
OverClocked, and the VG remix community in general. Check it out&#8230; and
  
keep on truckin&#8217;.
