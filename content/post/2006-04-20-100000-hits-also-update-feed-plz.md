Today is a joyous day for ThaSauce. It is on this day, a little less than a year after launching, that we&#8217;ve reached 100,000 hits. One-hundred-fricken-thousand. Awesome. Regretably neither me nor Xerol were actually aroudn to witness it, but oh well. It is ALSO on this day that I bring you 2 (quasi-)new features. Well&#8230;both of them have actually been around for alittle while, but I never really made them _LIVE_ until now&#8230;
  
First of which is <a target="_blank" href="http://psp.thasauce.net">ThaSauce (PSP)</a>. After seeing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgcats.com">VGCat</a>&#8216;s <a target="_self" href="http://www.vgcats.com/psp/">PSP version comic</a>, I thought it would be cool to make a version of ThaSauce that was viewable through the PSP browser. Big thanks to NNY and OCRE for their feedback. _(OCRE actually provided me with a few photos that I&#8217;ll add alittle later for anyone who&#8217;s interested in how it actually looks on a PSP.)_

Second is a new feed provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home">FeedBurner</a>. It&#8217;s really preferred that everyone who subscribes to our RSS feed switch to the FeedBurner version, because it&#8217;s way better formatted and compatible with more browsers, and also helps us keep track of how many people subscribe. You can find the new feed on the bottom of the page, or <a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThaSauce">here works too</a>. =P

So, in closing, I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who&#8217;s helped us get this far. All those people who&#8217;ve registered on the site, all those people who&#8217;ve submitted news and content, everyone who&#8217;s contributed to <a href="http://wiki.thasauce.net" target="_blank">ThaWiki</a>, submittied a song to <a href="http://remix.thasauce.net" target="_blank">ReMix:ThaSauce</a>, posted on <a href="http://forums.thasauce.net" target="_blank">our forums</a>, or even just VISITED the site. Thanks. ThaSauce is completely depend on the participation, dedication, and feedback of it&#8217;s userbase and it&#8217;s good to see that we&#8217;ve come this far in such a short ammount of time despite numerous obstacles, naysayers, and people who just generally choose to ignore it exists. We DO exist, and we&#8217;re not going away any time soon =P.

Thanks again!
