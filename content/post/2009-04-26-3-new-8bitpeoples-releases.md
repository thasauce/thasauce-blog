    <p>
      Cornbeast<br /> delivers Chip Hero, five songs from the soundtrack of an imaginary<br /> future video game where players perform along with the chip music hits<br /> of tomorrow, using controllers resembling the gaming gear of yesterday.<br /> Post-modern musical sensibilities collide with pre-information-age<br /> hardware, not so much closing the loop as introducing something<br /> unconventional, unexpected, and occasionally upbeat.

      As<br /> Roland walked on through the desolation, he was acutely aware that he<br /> had lost something intangible. His only clues came to him by way of the<br /> DMG in his pocket. The lamprey was willing, for the moment, to help him<br /> search the debris for the small cartridges that fit into the DMG, each<br /> one supplying a new, crucial piece of information. The hidden truth<br /> would be thus revealed to him slowly, in sequence.

      &#8220;Claps<br /> and Leads&#8221; marks Mr. Spastic&#8217;s triumphant return to the 8bitpeoples<br /> catalogue; five deft exercises in virtuoso programming, balancing<br /> intricate technical skill with a warmly organic sound, all delivered in<br /> his signature bold-yet-delicate tech-soul style. Jazz, deep funk,<br /> disco, R&B, and full-on techno inflections collide and merge into<br /> an astonishing stylistic cocktail, all topped off with a shimmering<br /> pro-grade production sensibility. Dazzling artwork by Ui completes the<br /> package, sealing the deal on a certain future classic.
