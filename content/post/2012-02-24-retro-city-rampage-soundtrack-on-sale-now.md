</center>Coming at you with fast-paced arcade action, 

_[Retro City Rampage](http://www.retrocityrampage.com/)_ is an upcoming cross-platform parody of epic proportions that promises to &#8220;take modern game mechanics and mash them into an authentic 8-bit experience&#8221;. Although the trailer for the game marks intrigue here at ThaSauce (preorder _Retro City Rampage_ [here](http://www.retrocityrampage.com/buy.php)), we&#8217;d like to focus attention to the #1 selling album on Bandcamp that has just been released, theÂ _Retro City RampageÂ _soundtrack_,_ whichÂ features phenomenal music by what may be one of the best collaborations in the VGM scene right now. Award-winning artists like [2011 OSV Composer of the Year](http://www.originalsoundversion.com/osv-composer-of-the-year-award-2011-jake-kaufman/) Â [virt](http://www.biglionmusic.com/)Â (Jake Kaufman), [Norrin Radd](http://ocremix.org/artist/4453/norrin-radd) (Matt Creamer) and [Freaky DNA](http://freakydna.com/) (Leonard J. Paul) have come together to form an ultimate trifecta for the sake of high-quality chiptunes in the style of the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

The _Retro City Rampage_ soundtrack showcases the best of what these composers have to offer, starting off with virt&#8217;s &#8220;Retro City Rampage Title Song&#8221; that reminds us of hard-hitting chip music at it&#8217;s finest with frenetic chords and frantic transitions. Norrin Radd&#8217;s &#8220;Renegade&#8221; thoroughy brings us back to the &#8216;badassery&#8217; that has since delineated fighting arcade games since the &#8217;80s while Freaky DNA&#8217;s &#8220;Half Steppin'&#8221; just rules overall with rugged, catchy beats, adding to the coarse, yet contemporary take on NES-dependent chiptunes.

While the full digitalÂ _Retro City Rampage_ soundtrack is available on [Bandcamp](http://retrocityrampage.bandcamp.com/album/retro-city-rampage-soundtrack) for a paltry $8, you can also elect to buy an individual limited edition hand-numbered vinyl that retains high-quality tunes for something more special. [Order now](http://lotusaudio.com/retrocityrampagevinyl.htm), and you&#8217;ll also receive a poster of the cover album art byÂ Maxime TrÃ©panier and a CD case.
