As many of you know, last year, I headed a project called <a href="http://www.williammichael.net/aocc" target="_blank">An OverClocked Christmas</a>, which brought together some very talented individuals who gave us eleven tracks of very cool Christmas music.  Well, I&#8217;m at it again this year.  I&#8217;ve started An OverClocked Christmas: Volume 2, and it&#8217;s the next logical step.
  
It&#8217;s an open project, so anyone who is interested in contributing a
  
track can submit a WIP (by the first WIP date, of course) for the
  
project.  It&#8217;s a small project, and runs until Monday, December 22.
  
The first WIP deadline is Wednesday, December 10 at 11:59pm.  Which
  
means, I have to have it in my inbox by then (see <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=19744" target="_blank">thread</a> at OCR for more info).

Anyone
  
interested in joining the project, please check the first post, and
  
post in the thread to let me know that you&#8217;re joining so I can add you
  
to the main post.  Also, there is no limit on the number of songs you
  
can do, as long as you can handle the work load, I&#8217;m always happy to
  
accept multiple songs from the same artist.
