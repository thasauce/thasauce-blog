I&#8217;d like to apologize right away for the pop-up ads. A friend of mine gave me a really good offer, and I REALLY need the money right now. Plus I&#8217;d like to be able to make enough to put towards the next batch of shirts since the demand @ MAGFest was so high (by the way, 1 large still availible if anyone wants it).

Anyway the ads&#8217;ll only be around for a few days or so. They&#8217;re by
  
no means permanant or even long term. So do me a favor and be sure to
  
navigate with the nav box on ThaSauce and move all around R:TS with the
  
top navigation :(.
