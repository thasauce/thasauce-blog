_Hey look, it&#8217;s Friday again! So I know you all are prepared for VGM: Very Good Music tonight, right? We have a **guest host** this week, **new bumpers**, and .. umm .. **very good music** as usual. Join us in IRC at 10PM as Nerd King plays nerd music for nerds who like to nerd around with other nerds. Can you dig it?_
