What
  
doth the end of September bring for VGDJ? Seek, and ye shall find&#8230;
  
Episode 059. This show may be one of our shortest in recent times (less
  
than 30mb!), but we&#8217;ve still got your wacky, weekly hookup to the OCR
  
community. The compo scene is finally heating up, we get to talk about
  
our friends the tentacles again (though, in a slightly different way),
  
and perhaps most notably, we have a new contest giving away some newly
  
printed OCR shirts/hoodies! What&#8217;s it about, you ask? Why, download the
  
show, and hear for yourself.
