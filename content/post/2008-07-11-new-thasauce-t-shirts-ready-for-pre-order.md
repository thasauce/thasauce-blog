    The design is finished, and I&#8217;m ready to order the shirts. I just need to know how many to get. Right now shirts will cost $20 a piece, which includes shipping. HOWEVER the more pre-orders I can, the cheaper the price gets. I&#8217;d like to see it get down to around $15, but it&#8217;s really up to you people.
