Anyone in and around Toronto (Ontario, Canada), or anyone willing to
  
trek from further, is welcome to come to the &#8220;Summer Edishun&#8221;
  
of the OCR Toronto meet. We had about a dozen people come out last
  
winter and all had a good time.

July 23rd at Noon is what we know so far. Probably going to meet downtown somewhere, just not completely sure yet. 

Also a VGDJ podcast will be recorded during the meet so come be a part of it!
