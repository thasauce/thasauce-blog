Garnering over 3,000 subscribers and 359,800 video views in under a year with only six videos , the [Super Guitar Bros.](http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperGuitarBros?feature=watch) have been making headway with their amazing video game covers. Little is known about their background in music except formal training in classical guitar, but all we really care about is that bothÂ Steven Poissant andÂ Sam Griffin take their sessions seriously and really know how to put on a captivating show.

The &#8220;Final Fantasy &#8211; Medley&#8221; video Â by Super Guitar Bros. is definitely a great example of how the pair work to complement each other in an almost ethereal manner, carefully arranging iconic songs such as &#8220;Chocobo Theme&#8221; and &#8220;The Prelude&#8221; to include a heavy air of nostalgia that is surely not to be missed.Â Armed with steel and nylon string guitars, these bros (and no, they&#8217;re not related) will make you think twice about all those bad YouTube covers you thought you listened through already.
