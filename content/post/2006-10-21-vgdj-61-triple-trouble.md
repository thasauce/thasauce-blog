This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):  
_  
&#8220;Like,
  
video games? Video game music? Umm, like, that&#8217;s SOOO dorky! But we
  
don&#8217;t care! Even though djpretzel and Rama have been lazing around,
  
we&#8217;ve been joined by a special guest to spice things up; it&#8217;s Doug
  
&#8220;DrumUltimA&#8221; Perry! And not just on a short segment either._
  
_&#8220;He&#8217;s here
  
to assist us with every aspect of Episode 061, from the remix roulette,
  
to [MAGFest](http://www.magfest.org/) coverage, to our new Halloween Cosplay Contest. YEP!
  
Surely you didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d let all of you steadfast video game fans
  
go more than a week without giving you more chances to win some more
  
swag, did you? You download! You download show!&#8221;_
