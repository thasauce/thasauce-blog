Hey folks!</p> 

We&#8217;re now accepting donations which will be turned into a pre-order for
  
what we&#8217;re calling the MAGFest M4 &#8220;Remember-Pak&#8221;. Basically, you&#8217;ll get
  
audio files in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis of the concert, a bunch of
  
pictures and videos, a program book (just in case you lost yours), an
  
oldschool flyer, and if you want some M5 flyers we&#8217;ll send those along
  
too.</em>
  

  
_Donate $20 to MAGFest and receive an M4 Remember-Pak</p> 

which includes:

MAGFest M4 Concert on DVD in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis  
Another DVDR with pictures and videos from MAGFest M4  
MAGFest M4 program booklet (just in case you didn&#8217;t get one)  
&#8220;Old-school&#8221; M4 flyer (ha!)  
Any other cool junk we might be able to find laying around  
We&#8217;ll even put the DVDs in a snazzy case with some cool printout.

Please note!  
We currently don&#8217;t have a shipping date.  
It&#8217;ll be ready when it&#8217;s ready.  
As soon as it is, it&#8217;ll go out to you.</em>
