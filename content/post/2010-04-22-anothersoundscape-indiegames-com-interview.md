> An interview I did withï¿½<a rel="nofollow" href="http://jeriaska.com/" target="_blank">Jeriaska</a>ï¿½for IndieGames.comï¿½**<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/04/pax_east_music_qa_mattias_hagg.html" target="_blank">JUST WENT LIVE!</a>**
> 
> I talk a bit about my work with Morsel, some of my upcoming work, indie game&rsquo;s music, my work on OCR, IWADON and how I go about making music. Be sure to give it a read and leave a comment, it&rsquo;s interesting stuff if you&rsquo;re the least bit interested in what I do!

> I&rsquo;ll also take this opportunity to tell you aboutï¿½**<a rel="nofollow" href="http://n.anosou.com/" target="_blank">n.anosou</a>**, my new side-project. It&rsquo;s basically a tiny little netlabel that will be mainly for me and friends/colleagues to release original music you can&rsquo;t find elsewhere. The thought is releasing miniature albums with 5-7 original tracks every now and then. Keep a look out in the coming weeks for snippets from the first release and DEFINITELY look forward to the first release itself!
