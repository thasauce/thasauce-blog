From the VGDJ Website, &#8220;Boy, have we got a show for you! We&#8217;ve kicked off our first ever
  
Awkward Trivia Giveaway contest, where you can win some great CD&#8217;s from
  
SGX, including his brand new album, Chroma. But that&#8217;s just the
  
beginning. For your listening pleasure, we&#8217;ve baked a (zircon) birthday
  
cake layered with ReMix Reviews, meetup madness, interviews with radio
  
personalities Liontamer and D-Lux, and of course a zesty stinger on top! It&#8217;s time to quit your podcast diet and gorge yourself on VGDJ 046. Nom nom nom&#8230;&#8221;
