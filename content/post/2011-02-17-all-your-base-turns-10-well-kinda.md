Some places on the internet are marking this week as the 10 year anniversary of the infamous &#8220;All Your Base&#8221; meme. True, it was 10 years ago this week that All Your Base flash video using the Invasion of the Laziest Men of Mars song was released to the internet, and quickly made it&#8217;s way into fame, however anyone familiar with OverClocked ReMix&#8217;s origins knows that&#8217;s not where the real tale begins.



Before OverClocked ReMix became OverClocked ReMix, it was simply just [OverClocked](http://overclocked.org/); a web comic dedicated to emulation, amongst other things, by djpretzel himself. It was here that All Your Base first made it&#8217;s way into the spotlight on June 5, 2000 with the &#8220;[ZeroWing Dub Project](http://www.overclocked.org/OCzerowing.htm)&#8220;; nearly a year before it would hit the mainstream. A full timeline of the events leading up to the All Your Base phenomenon can be found [here](http://www.frogstar.com/content/time-line-all-your-base-are-belong-us).

So while the rest of the internet reflects back on the memes of the past, us video game remix fans can celebrate that video game remixes aren&#8217;t the only thing David is responsible for popularizing. We can all also become extremely depressed at how old we&#8217;re getting ;-;
