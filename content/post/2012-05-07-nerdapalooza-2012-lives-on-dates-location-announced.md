Nerdapalooza&#8217;s head honcho John &#8220;hex&#8221; Carter has just announced on the [official website](http://nerdapalooza.org/) that the festival will be making a bigger and betterÂ comeback than ever before for 2012! Nerdapalooza 2012 will take place on the weekend ofÂ **August 3rd to 5thÂ **at The SocialÂ andÂ the BeachamÂ in downtown Orlando, Florida. Both venues will be much larger than previous Nerdapalooza locations;Â The BeachamÂ will act as the primary stage, holding over 1,200 attendees while The SocialÂ will act as this year&#8217;s secondary stage that will hold around 500 people.Â The line-up for Orlando&#8217;s biggest nerd festival is also looking amazing as [Metroid Metal](http://www.metroidmetal.com/), [Danimal Cannon](http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/), [brentalfloss](http://brentalfloss.com/home.cfm), [the OneUps](http://theoneups.com/), and [Random Encounter](http://randomencounterband.com/) will be returning once again to rock your world, while other performances will be announced soon.

Touted as a &#8216;brand new experience&#8217;, the festival will be sure to please those who plan to return this year.Â The Friday Pre-Party is also coming back as a free event with live performances and free food & beer at the Social, with the main performances occurring at the Beacham starting Saturday, August 4th.Â Â Tickets for admission and announcements for discount hotel prices will also be made public on the Nerdapalooza website within the week, so be sure to check back or head on over to the [official website](http://nerdapalooza.org/) to get your nerd on.
