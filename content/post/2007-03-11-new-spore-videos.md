About a year ago, we [took a look at Will Wright&#8217;s latest project, &#8220;Spore&#8221;](modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=240) &#8211; and this video was already a year old. At one point we were hearing release dates as early as Fall 2006; six months later, we&#8217;re still no closer to seeing an actual release date.
  
However, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167215.html">GDC 2007</a>, there&#8217;s at least some new video. The following is a compilation of six short gameplay segments demonstrated recently.
