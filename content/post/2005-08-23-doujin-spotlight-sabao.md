On today&#8217;s doujin spotlight, I&#8217;d like to bring your attention to a
  
Japanese remixer by the name of Sabao, who has a Japanese site which is
  
for some Japanese reason entitled <a href="http://sabao.hp.infoseek.co.jp/" target="_blank">&#8220;Mackerel Sky&#8221;</a> (click on the &#8220;MP3&#8221; link).
  
The reason I actually posted this was to talk about his newest <a href="http://sabao.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mp3.htm" target="_blank">release.</a>
  
An arrangement of Castlevania 3&#8217;s &#8220;Demon Seed,&#8221; it combines
  
elements of both orchestral and jazz music to create one groovalicious
  
whole, with radio chatter samples inexplicably sprinkled
  
throughout the entire song. To top it all off, the Stage 1 theme and Vampire Killer also appear as
  
cameos in
  
the solo section, making this remix an all-around irresistible package for any fan of CV.

Don&#8217;t forget to check out his other stuff, too. Slightly more obscure, but worth listening to all the same.
