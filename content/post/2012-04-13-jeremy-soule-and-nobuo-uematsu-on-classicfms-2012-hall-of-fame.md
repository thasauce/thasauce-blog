[Classic FM](http://www.classicfm.co.uk/), the UK&#8217;s most popular commercial radio station, and savings bank [NS&I](http://www.nsandi.com/) have partnered together to host Classic FM&#8217;s [2012 Hall of Fame](http://halloffame2012.classicfm.co.uk/), touted as &#8220;the ultimate chart in classical works&#8221; that ranges from 300 of the best sonatas, symphonies, concertos and choral works of the year by public vote.

One may ask, &#8220;Why is ThaSauce writing about some random classical charts in the UK?&#8221;. Well, this year marks avid success for the video game vote-campaign, as Jeremy Soule&#8217;s work on TESV: Skyrim [has reached number 238](http://halloffame2012.classicfm.co.uk/individual/?position=238)Â withÂ [&#8220;Dragonborn&#8221;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsnRQJxanVM) being highlighted as Soule&#8217;s most prolific work., while Nobuo Uematsu [has reached a whopping number 16](http://halloffame2012.classicfm.co.uk/individual/?position=16) Â onÂ this year&#8217;s Hall of Fame with [&#8220;Aerith&#8217;s Theme&#8221;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIqKWLkm2-g)Â as the second highest new entry within the charts.

Congratulations to both composers and a big &#8216;hoo-ha!&#8221; to the VGM community, which definitely shows that with enough persistence, video game music truly has a chance to shine as individual musical pieces of beauty and grace just as much as a Beethoven or Chopin work.
