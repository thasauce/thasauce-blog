From [Slashdot](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/15/1312202):

Opera has announced that they and Nintendo are going in together to [create a web browser for the DS](http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/02/15/). The browser, based on Opera&#8217;s core engine, will take advantage of the system&#8217;s two screens and the touchscreen to provide on-the-go portable internet access. From the article: &#8220;Within just five seconds of turning on the system, the Nintendo DS is already fully operational. This makes it the ideal device to enable people to swiftly obtain the latest information from the internet, wherever they are.&#8221;
