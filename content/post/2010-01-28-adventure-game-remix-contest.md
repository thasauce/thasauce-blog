<a href="http://ocremix.org/forums/member.php?u=32063" target="_blank">Artropos</a> posted <a href="http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=27333" target="_blank">on OverClocked ReMix</a>:

> Welcome to the first ever*Â **Adventure Game Remix Contest**!Â 
> 
> Do you know what King&#8217;s Quest is? How about Monkey Island? Whether you know of them or not, you could win stuff by making a remix for the competition.
> 
> This contest is open to everyone. Our goal is to give something back to the remix artists who help make this site what it is, and hopefully expose you to some adventure games in the process. Some of the classic adventure games helped shape what the gaming experience is like today, so it&#8217;s a good time to give them a little recognition. ðŸ™‚
