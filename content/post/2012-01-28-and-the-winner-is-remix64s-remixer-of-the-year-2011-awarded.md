[Remix64](http://www.remix64.com/)&#8216;s Remixer of the Year Awards 2011 was hosted today on [SceneSat Radio](http://scenesat.com/)Â with the first part of the show starting off with an extensive recap of 2011, showcasing top tracks of each month and scene happenings. With the second half featuring the actual award show,Â the results have been quite thrilling:

The award was presented by Andreas WallstrÃ¶m of c64.com. It should be noted thatÂ [Kate Z.](http://www.remix64.com/act/kate_z/)Â would have actually won this category with her Tusker remix, if the votes for both versions (vocal / non vocal) had been combined.

We would like to congratulate those who made it on the lists this year and the winners of each award. Without such a great community, we would like to think that the VGM scene would surely falter from lack of support. Keep up the good work! If you missed the actual event, you can [use SceneSat&#8217;s reLive feature](http://scenesat.com/relive) to catch the show in its entirety. Remixer of the Year 2012 [h](http://www.remix64.com/roty.html)[as also commenced](http://www.remix64.com/roty.html), so don&#8217;t forget to vote. Here&#8217;s to hoping that next year&#8217;s show will be even more astounding!
