 [Mega Ran](http://megaran.com/) and his cohorts are hitting the road&#8230; and your face! In his most recent musical stint, the Capcom-licensed rapper Mega Ran will be embarking on theÂ **VS TourÂ **Â throughout the United States, beginning in Arizona and concluding the tour with a final bang at [SXSW Music](http://sxsw.com/music), one of the biggest music festivals in the country with more than 2,000 performers. With big names like [Adam Warrock](http://www.adamwarrock.com/), [Willie Evans Jr.](http://www.myspace.com/willieev), andÂ [DJ DNÂ³](http://dn3music.bandcamp.com/) on deck for their first &#8216;interactive tour&#8217;, we guarantee that you&#8217;ll be shuffling to what could possibly be one of the best live performances of the year. Oh, and we forgot to mention that Mega Ran plans to hold small fighting game tournaments wherever possible. Who else do you know that does that?!

While the tour is scheduled for this coming Spring, Mega Ran has started a [funding campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/The-VS-Project)Â with the same name to help raise money for support. With a goal of $2500 in mind and the campaignÂ ending onÂ **Tuesday, March 13th**, Mega Ran and his dudes have set up sweet packages as incentives for you to help out: $5 will get you audio of the project itself, $10 a physical copy of the VS Project, $15 an exclusive poster and EP, and so on.Â Â The list of locations and dates for the VS Tour is also located below. If interested, please help support Mega Ran&#8217;s endeavors into the touring world&#8230; We promise that you won&#8217;t be disappointed.
