It&#8217;s a bit late in the month to be posting this, but I just found it myself. The [RPM (&#8220;Record Production Month&#8221;) Challenge](http://www.rpmchallenge.com) isn&#8217;t a competiton, but &#8220;[the] point is they get busy and stop waiting around for the muse to appear. Get the gears moving. Do something.&#8221;
  
There are a few restrictions: the album has to be completely recorded in February (of this year), there&#8217;s a minimum of 35 minutes or 10 tracks, and entries must be put on CD and mailed in (postmarked by March 1st). You can read the full details [here](http://www.rpmchallenge.com/content/view/844/1/).
