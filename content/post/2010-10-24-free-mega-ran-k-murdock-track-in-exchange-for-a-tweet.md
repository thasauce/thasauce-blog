Random has [recently announced on his twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/MegaRan/status/28563463900) that he and K-Murdock have released their newest song TYFL for free in exchange for a tweet.

All you have to do is [visit the link](http://www.tweetforatrack.com/RandomandKMurdock), enter your e-mail, send the tweet, and receive a free song! Random has been doing a great job and finding new and different ways to utilize the internet and social networking to promote his music, and this is just another great example of it.

I highly recommend everyone do this. It takes no time at all and you should be willing to grab every free track Random puts out, and spread the word. He&#8217;s a great guy and an extremely talented artist.
