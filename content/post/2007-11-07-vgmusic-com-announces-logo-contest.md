VGMusic announced last week that they are having a logo contest:



<div class="quoted-text">
  The Video Game Music Archive would like to have a logo of its very own. We would like to use the new logo not only as part of a redesign of our front page, but also on business cards, stationary, and anywhere else an organization logo might appear&#8230; can anyone say t-shirts! This is your chance to win a $100 store credit to CocoeBiz/VGM World.
</div>
