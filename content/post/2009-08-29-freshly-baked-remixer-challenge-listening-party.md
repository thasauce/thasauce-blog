This year&#8217;s Freshly Baked ReMixer challenge, and we&#8217;re holding a listening party tomorrow at 6PM PST/ 9PM EST so everyone can have a chance to listen to the songs everyone has been working on over the past 2 months.Â  The listening party will be held in <a href="irc://irc.enterthegame.com/thasauce" target="_self">#thasauce on irc.enterthegame.com</a>.

> Way back in 2002 a forum user name &#8220;I Like Cookies!&#8221; (now just Jeff), ran a 1-shot competition called the Freshly Baked ReMixer challenge. In the thread artists signed up and were assigned challenges posted by other forum users. This is how artists like myself, Suzumebachi, and GLL all got our starts. There were also some other impressive tracks by Disco Dan and a few others.
> 
> Some time later the same user did the Second Annual FBRC which, while not as popular as the first one, still saw some solid success.
> 
> Since the competition has long been forgotten by most, and seeing all the talent that&#8217;s on OCReMix today, I think it&#8217;s time we try a revival.

For my info on the FBRC [check out the thread on OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=23498).
