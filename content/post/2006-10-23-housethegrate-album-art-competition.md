I&#8217;m<br /> running a competition on my website. I&#8217;ve posted some rough guidelines,<br /> and I&#8217;m hoping the rest of the community will help me out when I need<br /> it.</p> 

<p>
  If you&#8217;re at all skilled with graphic design, then please put your skills to a worthy cause. I don&#8217;t require much.</em>
