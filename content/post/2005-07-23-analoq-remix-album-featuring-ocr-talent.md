Today analoq released his remix album based on a 30 second original he wrote back in 2000.

It&#8217;s available in mp3 and ogg, butÂ analoq recommends getting the oggs   
because most of the tracks blend into one another, and mp3s aren&#8217;t   
sample accurate so there might be a click or gap between the tracks.   
He wanted the tunes to be inseparable like in a good DJ   
set rather than have &#8216;loose&#8217; transitions like albums generally do,   
so it is most definitely intended to be listened to all the way through.
