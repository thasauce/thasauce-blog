Due to extenuating circumstances, Zircon has left his position as co-host of VGDJ. The podcast is not officially dead yet, but Pixietricks is not currently looking for a replacement co-host at this time. Essentially the show will be on indefinite hiatus until we hear otherwise. However, don&#8217;t get your hopes up. Sorry folks. üôÅ

You can read Zircon&#8217;s news post with an explanation for what happened at [vgdj.net](http://www.vgdj.net/). Best of luck to both Zircon and Pixietricks from us here at ThaSauce.
