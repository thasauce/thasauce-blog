Chris Morris at CNN&#8217;s Game Over column reports that there is a push on for possible [representation of pro gaming at the 2008 Olympics](http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/31/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm?section=money_commentary). From the article: _&#8220;Television
  
networks are getting interested, too. NBC&#8217;s USA Network will air a
  
series of seven hour-long shows featuring Major League Gaming
  
tournaments this fall._ 
  
_But financial and network interest don&#8217;t earn a sport an Olympic
  
berth; Just ask fans of golf, motorcycle racing and bowling &#8211; or, for
  
that matter, baseball, which (along with softball) will be dropped from
  
the Olympics in 2012. And the fact that video gaming is so technology
  
dependent could be particularly damaging.&#8221;</p>
