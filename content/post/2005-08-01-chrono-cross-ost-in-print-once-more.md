It is a shame that we didn&#8217;t pay enough attention to figure this out
  
when it occurred a month ago, but it turns out that the &#8220;new Chrono
  
Cross arrange&#8221; noted by Mitsuda in January is actually a reissue of the
  
Chrono Cross Original Soundtrack. Procyon-Studios notes that demand was
  
so high that Square Enix authorized new copies to be printed.
  
This all went down June 16th, and copies of Mitsuda&#8217;s Creid album are
  
also in print again. You can grab them from Amazon.com&#8217;s Japanese
  
equivalent; these are the URLs Mitsuda provides us:

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009J8HB6/procyonstudio-22">Chrono Cross OST</a>  
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009J8HAW/procyonstudio-22">Creid</a>

Get them while they&#8217;re hot! Amazon should have facilities for US users who wish to buy Japanese goods there.

**Correction:**Â  It turns out the cross arrange is still
  
planned. mitsuda has it on his calendar at
