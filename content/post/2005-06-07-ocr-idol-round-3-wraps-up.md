OCR Idol Round 3 is officially complete. Through the democratic
  
process, users have chosen and voted on their least favorite songs out
  
of the bunch&#8230;
  
Less Ashamed of Self and Uncle
  
recieved the most votes this time around, and in turn were eliminated
  
from the competition. So I would personally like to wish them good luck
  
and thank them for
  
participating in OCR Idol. It&#8217;s been fun guys. ðŸ˜‰

On a related note, OCR Idol Round 4 has officially begun. This
  
round&#8217;s theme is Journey to Silius on NES, as chosen by S|r NutS. The
