<span class="small">Rise of the Star is a collection of remixes from<br /> the classic platformer, Kirby&#8217;s Adventure. With this project, we aimed<br /> to write character themes for each of the titles given to Kirby<br /> throughout the game. After nearly 10 months of work, the album has<br /> turned out to be quite a remarkable collection of remixes. We hope<br /> everyone enjoys our work.<br /> </p>

  The music is available on the site in MP3 format, and we&#8217;ve also got a torrent running on OCR&#8217;s BitTorrent Tracker (<a href="http://bt.ocremix.org/">http://bt.ocremix.org/</a>) where you can get both compressed MP3s and lossless FLACs.

  Thank You.</span>
