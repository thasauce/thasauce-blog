title: Replace Docs For Your Video Games

The goal of replacementdocs is to preserve and archive game documentation for
  
years to come. They are a community of gamers who appreciate the importance of
  
game documentation and know the frustration that comes when this documentation
  
is not available.

They have been around for several years now and currently offer Acrobat PDF
  
downloads of over 2000 different game manauals for various platforms. I know
  
they have secured explicit permission to host these manuals from some game
  
publishers and are working on getting permission from others. Some game
  
publishers, like Atari, actually link to replacementdocs from their technical
  
support website.
