[MMORPGs and game addiction.](http://www.twitchguru.com/2006/08/08/world_of_warcraft_players_addicted/)
  
If you&#8217;re suffering from dry eyes, headaches, back aches, erratic sleep
  
patterns, it may be more than just your average hangover: according to
  
Dr. Maressa Orzack, you could be suffering from video and computer game
  
addiction.
  
A clinical psychologist, Orzack is founder and coordinator of
  
Computer Addiction Services at McLean Hospital in Newton, Mass., and is
  
also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Computer
  
Addiction Services is one of the few outpatient clinics in the U.S.
  
that provides specific treatment for game addiction.
