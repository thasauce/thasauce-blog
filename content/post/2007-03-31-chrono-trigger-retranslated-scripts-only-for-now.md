Chrono Trigger has been completely retranslated by KWhazit. After a bunch of work, we&#8217;ve got two spreadsheets, HTML for people without Microsoft Office, a big name guide, and an even bigger article highlighting the important differences lost in the original translation for those who don&#8217;t want to read the entire thing.

We&#8217;re debating whether to try and rush out a playable patch with Temporal Flux right now.
