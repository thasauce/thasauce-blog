  Dwelling of Duels, hosted by VGMix is a community wide compo where the main instrument must be played live.  This attracts a variety of talent and often produces amazing results.  Every month, a theme is chosen which must be followed.  Participants have one month to complete their tracks, songs are voted for on the last day of every month.

    This month is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28third_generation%29">8-bit systems</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28fourth_generation%29">16-bit systems</a>. All entries must choose a side and play songs that were originally written for a game on a system from that side (NES, Sega Master System, SNES, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, etc.)<br /> For simplicity&#8217;s sake, we will limit this to actual consoles and not allow handhelds (like the Game Boy) or PC models (like the MSX). Songs are due on Sunday, April 26th at 9:30 PM Eastern US time. <a href="irc://irc.vgmix.com/">irc.vgmix.com #dod</a> listening party to be held Monday, April 27th at 9:30 PM Eastern.
