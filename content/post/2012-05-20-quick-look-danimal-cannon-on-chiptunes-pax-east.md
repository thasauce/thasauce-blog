Yeah, yeah. We know PAX East 2012 seemed like _[forever](http://thasauce.net/2012/02/06/concert-line-up-for-pax-east-finalized/)_ ago. And yes, we&#8217;ve probably covered everything from [live streams](http://thasauce.net/2012/04/07/pax-east-2012-live-streaming-event-on-twitch-tv/) of PAX East to some pretty cool [live shows](http://thasauce.net/2012/04/15/quick-look-the-protomen-on-stage-pax-east-2012/). But we figured that we can give you a little nostalgic run for those who went and for those who haven&#8217;t&#8230; well, we wanted to give you a more personal glimpse of the event itself. This week&#8217;s _Quick Look_ features the awesome [Danimal Canno](http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/)[n](http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/) sharing his seemingly infinite knowledge on chiptunes. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. An hour of one of the foremost artists within the chip music genre talking about chip music. Chippy, right? Although intended for a more general audience, we think that it&#8217;d be good for you to refresh or maybe even be (gasp) schooled on the subject. Check out the video above and let us know what you think.
