A couple weeks ago, the idea of a competition based entirely using FL Studio default samples arose. Now, [the competition has started](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=77427). While not intended to be a remix competition, per se, each competition will have a theme, and the theme for this is a remix from Zelda 2.
  
[chthonic](http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Chthonic) is running this first competition, and presents the following rules: 

  * All sounds and effects used to create entries must be FL default, ie. the stuff that comes packed with Fruity Loops.
  * You may not use Fruity Soundfont Player. SORRY. 
  * No instruments bought from the FL Store are allowed. 
  * When an entry is complete, the musician should provide both the final rendered .mp3 and the .flp file that corresponds to it, if possible. 
  * If an entrant only has the demo version of FL, he/she will not be required to provide the .flp. 
  * All versions of FL are acceptable for use. 
  * Entries must be in .mp3 format. 
  * Entries must be over 1:45 in length. 
  * Entries must correspond to the given theme.

After a poor response to the initial posting, the deadline has been extended to Wednesday, March 1, 2006.
