Danny B and Mr. Shnabubula are no longer judges at OCR.

After a long and honorable stay as Judge, Mr. Baranowsky has left his
  
post in order to pursue his career in the film industry. Since joining
  
the panel in February 2004 as well as being a long time contributer to
  
the site, he has become a valued and respected member of the OCR
  
Community. His departure as judge may come as a surprise to some, but
  
he will be missed by all.<span class="postbody"><br /> </span>

After a relatively short stay as Judge, Shnabubula was decidedly
  
removed from the panel through an agreement by his fellow Judges. &#8220;<span class="postbody">He<br /> just wasn&#8217;t a fit with the panel for various<br /> reasons and we have decided it would be better to part ways with Shna<br /> at this point.&#8221; says GrayLightning. Many doomsayers have pounced on<br /> this news, making vague accusations about foul play by DJP and the rest<br /> of the judges. DJP has responded to such accusations: &#8220;</span><span class="postbody">While the usual dirt-diggers might try to read a<br /> lot between the lines here, which isn&#8217;t surprising, I&#8217;m cool with Sam,<br /> Sam appears to be cool with me & the rest of the panel&#8230; In general this just wasn&#8217;t very scandalous, nor<br /> do I think it reflects poorly on anyone in particular.&#8221; he says. In any case, we&#8217;ll be sad to see him go.</p> 

<p>
  DJP is expected to make an announcement about this turn of events in an<br /> upcoming write-up. There are no plans to replace these gentlemen on the<br /> panel in the near future.</span>
