<span style="font-weight: 400;">ThaSauce Network is excited to announce a milestone event in our community&#8217;s history &#8212; the 400th round of <a href="http://compo.thasauce.net/compos/view/OHC">One Hour Compo</a>, hosted by starla. <a href="http://compo.thasauce.net/">Compos</a> (short for “composition competitions”) are competitions for musicians who want to “think outside the box” and challenge themselves.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it works. One Hour Compo happens every Thursday at 9PM EST. Every week, a new theme is announced, and participants are encouraged to remix a track based on their interpretation of the theme. They are given one hour to create, complete, and submit their tracks &#8212; after that, submissions are off to voting! The event ends with a listening party featuring the week’s top submissions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 400th compo round will happen on <strong>June 9th at 9pm</strong> EST, and you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1602093720118185/">RSVP to the Facebook event</a> to stay updated. Musicians of all skill levels are invited to join in. There is no requirements for OHC, other than wanting to participate and have a good time creating good music. We encourage everyone to join, and help us make the 400th one a compo to remember!</span>
