_So, last year I had a revelation: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go on a roadtrip and promote MAGFest!&#8221; But, I was a bum (I guess I still am) and we couldn&#8217;t pull it off. But damnit, I can now! So, I did a handful of planning and mapping and phonecalls and talking and stuff._
  
_At last, a car has departed today from my house containing myself, my housemate Ogre, and Wire, the guitarist from swedish videogame coverband Game Over (who as a bonus has never been to the states). Our mission is to bring MAGFest in the form of videogames, rocking out, partying, and, well, driving to a bunch of those folks that traveled from all over the country to come to our wonderful event.</p> 

Our map is here: <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/2h5hp6">http://tinyurl.com/2h5hp6</a>

If you&#8217;re at or near any of our stops, we&#8217;d love to do whatever. We \*probably\* can&#8217;t add any stops but if you can get to where we&#8217;re at, that&#8217;s best. I have unlimited text, data, nights+weekends, and a ton of minutes, so just poke my cellphone (aim cellgreenzebra) anytime, it doesn&#8217;t roam.

What we&#8217;re asking all our stops for is some food and a spot on the floor to sleep, but 7500 miles isn&#8217;t exactly a short trip so if anyone flings us even a few bucks for gas or an oil change (use the MAGFest donation button if you want), you rock.

We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing everyone!
