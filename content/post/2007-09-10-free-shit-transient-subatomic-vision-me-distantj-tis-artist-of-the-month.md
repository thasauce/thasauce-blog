Yet another self-released record by Transient, who already has something like 5 billion releases everywhere on the internet. If you already know how transient sounds, and you should, then this is more of the same crazy half-ambient half-glitch and usually pretty chill music. I enjoyed the whole thing, but if you don&#8217;t wanna dive right in I recommend &#8220;Pocket Universe,&#8221; &#8220;Stars,&#8221; and &#8220;Melts Away&#8230;,&#8221; the pretty ambient/pseudoorchestral track that ends the album much like &#8220;rpg&#8221; ended <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono211.com/content/releases/mtkmp174.html">Hexual Ceiling</a> I love archive&#8217;s streaming flash stuff that they have now. Makes searching for stuff so much more convenient ðŸ™‚

Reunion&#8217;s 50th release, and a cool psytrancey one at that. I&#8217;ve run out of new things to say about Reunion tracks so I&#8217;ll just say that this is your weekly dosage of UNTS. This is SV&#8217;s second release on Reunion.

Ssspoon! I finished this track at around 4 AM one night because I couldn&#8217;t sleep, much like how <a target="_blank" href="http://soundtempest.net/soc/album/oc-TheSkyisNeverDarkAnymoreEP.RAR">The Sky is Never Dark Anymore EP</a> was made. This will probably be the basis for my ALS4 release, so expect similar things come New Year&#8217;s Day. Awesome. In other news, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm/music/OverCoat">I have uploaded my albums to last.fm for streaming</a>, and uploaded 2 older albums of mine to my site, <a target="_blank" href="http://soundtempest.net/soc/album/oc-Supercats.RAR">Supercats</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://soundtempest.net/soc/album/oc-ubo%27srestaurant.rar">Ubo&#8217;s Restaurant</a>.

DistantJ is pretty much the only guy who makes anime remixes anymore. I tried recently and failed horribly. This one is pretty good. BIG UPS. Check it out if you&#8217;ve seen Slayers or like DistantJ or unts.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.traxinspace.com/aotm_092007.php">TiLT &#8211; TraxInSpace Artist of the Month</a>  
The AotM feature on TraxInSpace is BACK! This time it&#8217;s TiLT, someone I chill with in #renoise on EsperNet every now and then. The interview by roncli [who also chills in #renoise] explains everything, so check it out! Contains links to his music and everything else! He&#8217;s already got lots of free tracks [15 or so] available on his TiS page, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.traxinspace.com/song/34794">a Monkey Island remix</a> that you OCR fgts would probably enjoy.

That&#8217;s it for this week, unless I forgot something. This is the part where I ask you to mail me free shit. See you next week!
