  Coda wins this one! CONGRATZES. This theme was &#8220;Romantic Date&#8221; and boy was it&#8230; a horribly geeky date. Chip-rock, H-game midis, the whole works. In the end though it was coda&#8217;s smooth Kirby-esque guitar chord progression that won teh day. I seem to be sucking at compos again, getting my usual second-to-last place.

  CompoSTs [short for<br /> Compo and SoundTempest put together :)] are thematic videogame music<br /> OHCs, held in #soundtempest on EsperNet. They are scheduled whenever<br /> anyone feels like compoing.
</div>



<div align="justify">
  Formats allowed are mp3/ogg, and music modules [it,s3m,xm,mod].
</div>



<div align="justify">
  I<br /> host the CompoSTs personally and also participate. I pick the theme and<br /> regulate the start and end time. I also decide whether the channel<br /> votes on a winner or not [sometimes when I am tired, there is no voting<br /> :)]
</div>



<div align="justify">
  Come hang out in #soundtempest, and please let me know if/when you would like to have one.
