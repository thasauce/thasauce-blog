  VGM netlabel GameChops has recently presented its very first remix contest for Dj CUTMAN's track "Powerglove (It's So Bad)" featuring Benjamin Briggs, which takes a classic NES sample and throws in "a heaping dose of french electro and gritty automation to create something so good, it can only be called 'so bad'". Are you bad enough to enter?
