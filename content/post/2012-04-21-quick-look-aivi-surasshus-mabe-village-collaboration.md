[Aivi Tran](http://aivitran.com/)Â and sound designer [surasshu](http://surasshu-sound.com/)Â  have come together at this year&#8217;s Game Developer&#8217;s Conference for a pretty awesome collaboration, featuring &#8220;Mabe Village&#8221; from _The Legend of Zelda:Â Link&#8217;s Awakening._ When prompted of how the project came about, Aivi writes:

> Last month at GDC, I met Surasshu, a game composer/sound designer and friend who I knew of for chip music. I&#8217;d been curious about blending piano with chip sounds for awhile, so we decided to collaborate, starting with &#8220;Mabe Village&#8221; from Link&#8217;s Awakening. The whole process of this collab was way too fun &#8211; I cracked up every time we talked, and couldn&#8217;t keep a straight face in most of my video outtakes, either. Even in this video, I still end up with a big goofy smile!

Check out the product of their chip x piano collab above and be sure to check [Aivi&#8217;s YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/waltzforluma) for great VGM piano covers and more cool aivi & surasshu projects coming at you soon.
