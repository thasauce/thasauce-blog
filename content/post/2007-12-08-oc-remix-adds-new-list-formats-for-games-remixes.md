<div class="quoted-text">
  Tonight, after multiple hours of development that had my girlfriend<br /> yelling at me for breaking a promise to stop at 10:00pm, I uploaded<br /> modifications to OCR&#8217;s list system that, in my opinion, represent a<br /> substantial improvement.
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Multiple ReMixers are now credited, instead of just a count
    </li>
    <li>
      Multiple composers are now credited, instead of just a count
    </li>
    <li>
      Individual songs are listed, where available, for each mix
    </li>
    <li>
      Japanese names of both games and composers are presented in context
    </li>
    <li>
      Columns and font sizes have been rearranged for enhanced usability
    </li>
    <li>
      System icons have been added to help distinguish game/remix records
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Phew! Honestly, this was a boatload of work, and I wouldn&#8217;t be<br /> surprised if there are a couple issues that need to be fixed. Let us<br /> know what you think, and report any problems here! </div>
