<div>
  Sony may be forced to halt production on the Playstation 2 console and a large portion of its games, after a federal judge rejected an appeal to a patent infringement lawsuit by Immersion Corp. over the Dualshock technology used by the console, controllers, and games.

Sony lost the original case but appealed, and was allowed to continue to produce and sell the materials while the appeal was pending, but the order now goes into full effect now that the appeal has been denied. This also may affect whether the PS3 will have backwards compatibility with PS2 games that use the technology.
