My second full length, original electronic album, &#8220;Impulse Prime&#8221;, is
  
now ready for purchase online. I&#8217;ve spent a great deal of time on it,
  
using everything I&#8217;ve learned up until now and plenty of feedback from
  
OCR/SoundTempest community members. I&#8217;m very happy with the result and
  
I think anyone who likes electronic music (particularly artists like
  
Crystal Method and Prodigy) will enjoy it. 

You can listen to samples, read more about the CD, and purchase it for $11.99 (USD) here:
