His first release since &#8220;Toybox&#8221;, Shael has release a free to download album entitled &#8220;Bremelanotide&#8221;, by the band The Grammar Club. Also, there has been talk, for reference check the web site &#8211; <a href="http://thegrammarclub.com/" target="_blank">The Grammar Club</a>, about creating a secure download for an FLAC lossless version of the album with an eighth, bonus track, and instrumentals.

A quote from the site:

<div class="quoted-text">
  &#8220;So, we really want to start offering a secure download of a lossless<br /> FLAC version of Bremelanotide, complete with an eighth, bonus track,<br /> and instrumentals, in exchange for a $5 donation to Child&rsquo;s Play. We<br /> aren&rsquo;t sure how, though, to make that work logistically, with regards<br /> to setting up a page that would allow only users who&rsquo;ve donated to<br /> download.&#8221;
