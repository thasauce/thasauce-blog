Not ONLY will XBOX 360 soon be releasing a webcam for use over XBOX live making it incredibly simple for the average XBOX fanboy posing as a hot lesbain to attempt to coax other XBOX fanboys coaxing has hot lesbians into cyber/cam sex, if they actually CAN find an actualy girl, they can now help pleasure them&#8230;remotely.
			  
Thanks to Game Science for its post discussing [the Japanese announcement of the Xbox Video Chat hardware/software bundle](http://game-science.com/news/000626.html), which includes _  
&#8220;camera, 12 months of Xbox Live service, chat disc and Live Starter Kit.&#8221;_ 

Although [the product](http://www.xbox.com/ja-JP/videochat/default.htm) is   
_&#8220;being developed mainly in Japan&#8221;_, a release date in the West is likely, if currently unknown. However, with features including _&#8220;up
  
to 5 people video conferencing simultaneously&#8230; participation can be
  
restricted to invite only&#8230; send vibrations to participants&#8217;
  
controllers&#8221;_, the staid Brits at Eurogamer [are naturally horrified](http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=55819): _&#8220;Given the remote-rumble function and the fact the Xbox audience is
  
&#8216;adult&#8217;; well, our minds are boggling, frankly.&#8221;</p>
