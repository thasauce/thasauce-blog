On April 27, Analoq launched <a target="_self" href="http://compo.thasauce.net/">Compo: ThaSauce</a>. It&#8217;s a system for organizing compos, making it easier to submit, enter, and control what happens in a compo. It&#8217;s a unique system, and an excellent addition to the growing features here at ThaSauce.

The system is currently in a testing phase, and is being put through a run with <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=9306" target="_blank">ORC 103</a> on OCR.

In light of this, I have created from information provided by analoq a changelog where I will be documenting changes to Compo: ThaSauce. If you would like to view these changes, you can go <a href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Compo:_ThaSauce" target="_self">here</a>.
