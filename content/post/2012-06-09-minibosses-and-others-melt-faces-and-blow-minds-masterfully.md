excerpt: 'In case you haven''t been paying any attention at all to ThaSauce here,
  the Minibosses played in San Francisco on June 1, and it was one heck of a show.
  I was on hand to see it all go down, and this is how it went. '

8BitSF held another show on June 1, except unlike the last one in March this one featured The Minibosses. As usual, crashfaster was part of the lineup and Matthew Joseph Payne kicked the night off. The night was a blast, despite the small venue, but it was well worth the $10 at the door.

Matthew Joesph Payne, as mentioned above, was the first act of the night; his fusion of vocals and chip elements with either banjo or electric guitar was great. He also kept us warmed up between songs with some nice humor, even saying he was no Danimal during his fourth song. Before the third song, he mentioned getting into an internet argument and wanting to wrestle someone. Which he did, playfully, with a couple of audience members, while some battle-like chip music played in the background. He also had us sing along during the fifth song, which was in 13/8. He was also selling download codes for his [Bandcamp page](http://matthewjosephpayne.bandcamp.com "Get "Gargantuan Acoustic Locator!""), which I highly recommend checking out.

crashfaster came on next; it was their first show with a new singer, Keiko. They played a new song about halfway through their set in commemoration of their inclusion on the upcoming Chiptunes=WIN compilation, releasing Monday. They also played a few songs that I&#8217;d heard at the [March GDC show](http://thasauce.net/2012/03/16/8bitsf-presents-pow-indie-music-and-developers-collide/ "Article also written by me")Â along with others. The last song was a cover, and small mosh pit of four or five people formed during it; Matthew Joseph Payne ran from the back of the room to the front just to join it. All in all, a good set. They&#8217;ll be playing at the DNA Lounge in July, so keep an eye out for that.

Finally, the Minibosses took the stage. They started early purely for the purpose of playing more songs (and they still ended up playing later than they should have). They kicked the night off with Kid Icarus, and went right into requests after the lengthy track. It is interesting to note that they played the Ducktales theme song on four separate occasions during the night, something <a title="He was just another audience member." href="http://disasterpeace.com/" target="_blank">Disasterpeace</a> [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Disasterpeace/status/208843195948343296 "He also approved of it.") after the show. Naturally, I also sang the entire theme song each time. Between the Ducktales reprises, they played favorites such as Punch-Out, Castlevania 2, and Mega Man 2. A mosh pit formed during the Mega Man track, and another even bigger one during Contra, which followed after Ducktales. Zelda was immediately after, which created yet another even larger mosh pit during the Temple section. The final song was Metroid, which had a mosh pit so large it almost knocked several folks (myself included) over due to spreading out.

After the show, they brought out the CDs and shirts for sale, and those who weren&#8217;t buying anything had to leave because it was afterhours. All in all, it was a phenomenal show and one that I had a blast at. I&#8217;m sure all who went did as well, seeing as it was probably impossible not to. If there&#8217;s another show, which there invariably will be, I&#8217;ll be sure to go, and you can be sure to read about it in a summary such as this one not too long afterwards. Until next time, game on!

Or would rock on be more appropriate here?
