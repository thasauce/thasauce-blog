I&#8217;m holding a little competition to update some of the graphics on my site. You have to be able to make SVG images (try <a href="http://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>) and a little design experience wouldn&#8217;t hurt either.

The main prize is 100MB of storage for images, mp3s, etc. (with a 10MB file limit) and possibly some extra smaller prizes if I get good submissions from more than one person. Read the rules and how to enter <a href="http://h.xerol.org/viewstory.php?s=37" target="_blank">here</a>.
