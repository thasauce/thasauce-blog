_&#8220;In an effort to have another outlet for my video game music fandom/geekery, I&#8217;ve finally moved forward with a blog. Check it out at <a target="_blank" href="http://vgfrequency.blogspot.com/">http://vgfrequency.blogspot.com</a>. We&#8217;re big pimpin&#8217;. We&#8217;re spendin&#8217; cheese.&#8221;_

Larry&#8217;s first blog post, [How a Russo-Nigerian Stallion Found Video Game Music, Part 1: The Games](http://vgfrequency.blogspot.com/2007/04/how-russo-nigerian-stallion-found-video.html), outlines the very beginning of his interest in video game music. Part 2 (Radio) and Part 3 (OCR) will be posted soon. In Larry&#8217;s words, &#8220;It&#8217;s all scintillating material.&#8221;
