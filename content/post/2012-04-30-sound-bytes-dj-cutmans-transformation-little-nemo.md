</center>Yeah, yeah. We&#8217;re huge 

[Dj CUTMAN](http://www.djcutman.com/) fans here at ThaSauce. But can you blame us? With his charismatic presence [on-stage](http://www.youtube.com/v/tGXM0b3edeY), rad [live sets](http://soundcloud.com/djcutman/sets/mixes/) that mash up everything from dubstep to hip-hop to chiptunes,Â and [extensive knowledge](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fvideogamedj.com%2F&h=PAQFrVstg) of the video game music (or even electonic music overall, to which we entertain ourselves with his frequentÂ [Facebook updates](https://www.facebook.com/DjCUTMAN?ref=ts)), Dj CUTMAN _really_ has us going on. This time around, this captivating DJ takes his proficient skills in audio engineering up a notch to remix music from the NES platform _Little Nemo: The Dream Master._ &#8220;Transformation (Little Nemo)&#8221; is an intriguing yet nostalgic take on Junko Tamiya&#8217;s classic work, adding a more upbeat, house-y vibe that just begs for some rhythmical head-bobbing while listening.
