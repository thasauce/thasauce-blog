From <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=69843&#038;sid=262d2560ce666608deaa3655255eb472" target="_self">Ailsean&#8217;s post @ OCR</a>: &#8220;<span class="postbody">I <span>FINALLY</span><br /> got some webspace and set up a website. And you can get all my game<br /> arrangements there now, including ones you won&#8217;t find on VGMix, OCR,<br /> DOD, or OUS. Well, you could get them all by going to all of those<br /> sites and digging around, but they&#8217;ve never ALL been in one handy<br /> location like this before. Also, there are pictures and stuff.</p> 

<p>
  So go hit it up and stuff: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ailsean.net/">www.ailsean.net</a>&#8220;</span>
