Not many people still around today can remember the initial releases of <a href="http://www.zebox.com/projectx" target="_self">ProjectX and ProjectX2</a>, or even the days of <a href="http://www.superradiox.com./" target="_self">SuperRadioX</a>, but I know I certainly do. Recently <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&#038;u=103" target="_self">Rawk</a> has made a <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=60480&#038;sid=d7390613e7e1e02f69f756cf33199a6c" target="_self">suprise post on the OCR forums</a> with the first bit of news on any of the above in QUITE some time:__

_<span class="postbody">Hey everybody!</p> 

<p>
  I haven&#8217;t been here in a while. My latest private message is from 2003! Just wanted to let everyone know that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.projectxweb.com/">www.projectxweb.com</a><br /> is back up with a new design and new features (anyone know how I can<br /> get djpretzel to change the website link on our profile here)? Also,<br /> ROK and I are working on an all-new musical thing that is 10x bigger<br /> than anything we&#8217;ve done before. I don&#8217;t know when it will be done, but<br /> probably by the end of the year. It&#8217;s not game music, but I think you<br /> guys would like it anyway.
</p>

<p>
  I know it&#8217;s been a long time, but I hope some of you at least<br /> remember us. It wasn&#8217;t easy recording the Mega Man 2 & 3<br /> soundtracks in a dorm room with no drums!
</p>

<p>
  Oh yeah, and if anyone is interested, I&#8217;m also updating the Super Radio X forums to be all nice and neat and located right at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.superradiox.com./">www.superradiox.com.</a> Not that anybody cares about that anymore either.
</p>

<p>
  So&#8230; hello again! hope things have been well, and please visit our fancy new site</span></em>
