After hearing [Ellywu2](http://www.vgmix.com/users?Ellywu2)&#8216;s Cosmo Canyon arrangement, &#8216;[Smoke Signals](%20)&#8216;, on one of the final episodes of VGFrequency the other evening, I decided I HAD to go over to VGMix and grab it, and see what [other songs of E&#8217;s](http://www.vgmix.com/search.php?username=Ellywu2&show_songs=1&wip=1) I didn&#8217;t have. While there I decided to pick up [Final Fantasy 7 arrangement by him](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=919), as well as an [arrangement of the Minoc music](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=3281) from [Ultima Online](http://www.uo.com) (For the record that UO pre-3D when they changed it to the U9 music).
  
Anyway, after checking out what was new on the feed&#8217;s today, I had
  
noticed that Elly had released another new arrangement, this one of
  
Frog&#8217;s Theme from Chrono Trigger, entitled: &#8216;[Frog&#8217;s Intervention](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=4085)&#8216;. Being a newly found fan of him, and being as Frog&#8217;s theme has been absolutely excellent through-out history, I **had** to get this. In his description of the song Elly mentions that this is actually an arrangement for the [Chrono Symphonic Project](http://www.freewebs.com/chronosymphonic).
  
He also adds that it was done in the style of &#8220;Zimmer and friends.&#8221; I&#8217;m
  
not going to claim to have a good enough ear to be able to decypher a
  
Hans Zimmer-esque song, but I can say that I was absolutely satisfied
  
with this song both as a symphonic arrangement and as an arrangement of
  
one of my favorite songs in any game. Definitely worth checking out.

The next song I want to talk about it [GeckoYamori](%20)&#8216;s newest arrangement, &#8216;[Industroscout](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=4128)&#8216;, from [Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun](http://www.vgmix.com/search.php?game_name=Command+%26+Conquer%3A+Tiberian+Sun). Gecko has made [quite](http://www.vgmix.com/search.php?username=GeckoYamori&show_songs=1&wip=1) [a few](http://www.ocremix.org/detailremixer.php?mixerid=139)
  
impressive tracks in the past, so I knew that this one couldn&#8217;t
  
POSSIBLY be disappointing, and I was indeed correct. Gecko, whom has
  
shown countless times in the past that he is an avid [Klepacki](http://www.frankklepacki.com/) fan, had this to say about his mix:

_&#8220;The idea of the mix was to take the original and make it more
  
intense and hard-edged, and I think I achieved what I was going for. I
  
chose the title Industroscout as it sounds a bit similiar to
  
Industrofunk from Red Alert 2. I tried to keep myself from making it
  
sound all too buttrock-esque. The original track was pretty much built
  
on 1 riff, though I made some additions to keep it relatively fresh
  
sounding. The weird flanged thing in the original was a defining part
  
so I made a fairly accurate recreation of it. C&C music is very
  
hard to remix, I&#8217;ve tried dozens of times but this is the first time
  
I&#8217;m actually satisfied with what I&#8217;ve made.&#8221;_

C&C music is indeed quite difficult to arrange, I myself have
  
tried, and I must echo Gecko&#8217;s statement in saying that he did do an
  
excellent job with this one. Absolutely worth listening to.
