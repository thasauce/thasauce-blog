We really can&#8217;t say much about the new &#8216;chippage&#8217; that [beek](http://b-e-e-k.bandcamp.com/) has released, except that we expect nothing less from this chiptune veteran. While we&#8217;ve [praised his recent work before](http://thasauce.net/2012/02/14/beeks-7bit-date-robot-love-released-just-in-time-for-valentines-day/), beek stylishly hones his own retro influences and alters the chip genre to be something everyone can enjoy without discrimination. Â Peep his peppy, fun new tune above. &#8220;Kip&#8217;s Isle&#8221; is available to download for free [right here](http://soundcloud.com/b-e-e-k/kips-isle).
