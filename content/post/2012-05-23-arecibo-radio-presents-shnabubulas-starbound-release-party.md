Our friends over at [Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/) have once again outdone themselves by holding yet another epic listening party in the name of [one](http://thasauce.net/2012/03/20/shnabubula-releases-nes-jams-brains-melt/) of our [most](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/06/utterly-insane-preview-for-shnabubulas-upcoming-album-game-genie/) [admired](http://thasauce.net/2008/02/15/shnabubula-releases-yet-another-batch-of-chiptunes-this-time-in-16bit/) artists, the piano prodigy known as [Shnabubula](http://shnabubula.bandcamp.com/)Â on **Tuesday, May 29**:

> Holy smokes! Shnabubula is releasing a new album! The album is called _Starbound_, a forty-two minute-long synth odyssey spread across 5 movements. Anyone who is familiar with Sam&#8217;s music knows this is going to be good, so I know you guys are gonna be there!
> 
> Arecibo Radio will have the great fortune of hosting this event, check out our radio station atÂ <a href="http://www.areciboradio.com/" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">www.areciboradio.com</a>. It&#8217;ll immediately follow after a normally scheduled Touhou Tuesday, and you can join in & chat while the album&#8217;s being played live on the air via the on-site chat client, or using your preferred IRC client by connecting toÂ irc.esper.net #areciboradio.

The event will start at 10 PM Eastern (that&#8217;s 7 PM PST for you West Coasters). If you have NOT heard of Shnabubula&#8217;s mind-bending piano solos, we suggest heading over to both his [Bandcamp](http://shnabubula.bandcamp.com/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/Shnabubula) (check out one of our favorite songs [here](http://thasauce.net/2012/02/08/sound-bytes-shnabubula-covers-double-dragons-title-theme/)). This is definitely an event not to miss!
