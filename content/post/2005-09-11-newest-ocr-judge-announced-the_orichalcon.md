Last night with the posting of [Suzu&#8217;s track](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01402/) from [Rise of the Star](http://kirby.ocremix.org/), DJP also went on to announce the addition of [TO](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/to/) to the judges panel!
  
&#8220;_He&#8217;s been involved with the site for some time, both as a ReMixer and on the forums, and even thrashed the formidable Mr. GrayLightning a few times at the manly and testosterone-infused game of chess. We thus welcome him on board, so to speak, and promise to respect him and treat him as an equal&#8230; when not making cheap Paul Hogan jokes at his expense, and tying his kangaroo down, of course._&#8221; 

Congratulations to TO and good luck on the panel =P.
