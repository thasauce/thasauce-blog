  So SnappleMan posts this album on VGMix, with only him as the mirror, no zyko to be seen. But this is definitely zyko, and zyko fans will appreciate this release. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Survival&#8221; and has 6 tracks of the familiar zyko style. The VGMix thread and download link is here:<br /><a href="http://www.vgmix.com/vg25/viewtopic.php?id=1880">http://www.vgmix.com/vg25/viewtopic.php?id=1880</a>
