</center>Music prodigy Sam Ascher-Weiss, more often known as 

[Shnabubula](http://www.youtube.com/user/Shnabubula), has remained incredibly productive [as of late](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=36120). With almost 900 subscribers and over 231,000 views on YouTube, Shnabubula's reputation for piano improvisation and almost deranged time signatures cannot be denied.

Especially displaying his effortless talent with tracks like â€œPlaying Super Mario World While Taking Mushroomsâ€ and the ultimate MagFest 6 hit â€œTerra's Got Her Groove Backâ€ [here at ThaSauce](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/shnabubula/), we are thrilled to announce Shnabubula's forthcoming chiptune album _Game Genie._ â€œAqua Feverâ€, the latest track from the upcoming album_,_ is a breathtaking example of his natural ability to decipher key transitions with a drop of a hat.

Preview Shnabubula's insane talent on â€œAqua Feverâ€ for _Game Genie_ [here](http://youtu.be/AiZsE7Ma5_s), out on [Ubiktune](http://www.ubiktune.org/) soon!
