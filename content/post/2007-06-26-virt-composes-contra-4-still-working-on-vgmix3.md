On the OverClocked ReMix forums today, [Jake &#8220;virt&#8221; Kaufman](http://virt.vgmix.com/) posted [this little nugget of joy](http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showpost.php?p=287568&postcount=5) regarding the upcoming Nintendo DS game [Contra 4](http://kotaku.com/gaming/about-damn-time/konami-reveals-contra-4-ds-270587.php):

> Yep! I did music and sound design. I couldn&#8217;t confirm it until Mr. Bozon outed me himself, and I&#8217;m REALLY glad he did. I was worried that they&#8217;d think I violated my NDA if word got to them that people knew I was involved, even though I didn&#8217;t spill it.

virt&#8217;s music is influenced by that of old Konami games and shows powerfully in his chiptune works like <a target="_self" href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php?artist=Virt#8BP071">FX3</a>, so his soundtrack should fit the Contra feel very well. Even better news is that <a href="http://www.vgmix.com/" target="_self">VGMix3</a> has not been abandoned. Hopefully he&#8217;ll be able to devote more time to its development now that the Contra 4 soundtrack has been finished.
