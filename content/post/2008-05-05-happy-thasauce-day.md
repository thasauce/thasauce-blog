It&#8217;s hard to believe on this day 3 years ago a little brainstorm of mind became a reality. Looking back on it now, I&#8217;d have to say that ThaSauce has, in different respects, both fallen short of my expections and greatly exceeded them. Our userbase is constantly growing, we&#8217;re poised to make 1,000,000 hits within the next few month, but still there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement and a LOT of work to be done.

The first thing I&#8217;d like to give you guys today is 3 new mixes up on <a target="_self" href="http://remix.thasauce.net">ReMix:ThaSauce</a>. They are &#8216;Escape into Twilight&#8217; from NiGHTs by Skrypnyk, &#8216;In Search of Light&#8217; from Mega Man X4 by long-time OverClocked ReMixer and Judge DarkeSword, and &#8216;Pixelated Tales&#8217; from Tales of Symphonia by newcomer Showroom Dummy. I&#8217;m extremely pleased in how far R:TS has come, and we will continue to bring you guys excellent works from artist around the community that don&#8217;t quite fit into OCReMix&#8217;s guidelines for whatever reason. 

You will, however notice that R:TS has been rather stagnant. That&#8217;s partly to blame on my part, but it&#8217;s largely because we simply don&#8217;t have the submissions coming in. As of today we&#8217;ve barely recieved ANY submissions, save ones we&#8217;ve asked people for personally, all year. If you visit and enjoy ReMix:ThaSauce spread the word! The only way we can continue to provide you guys with music is if we have music to provide, and the only way we&#8217;re going to get more is if more people know. So if you know someone who&#8217;s remix can&#8217;t get on OCR for whatever reason and has never heard of R:TS, be sure to send them are way as we&#8217;d be MORE than happy to have them.

Another thing I wanna mention is shirts. The initial run of shirts sold out a LOT quicker than I had ever anticipated. Since then I&#8217;ve been working on ways to get enough money for a second run AND working feverishly on a new design (a work in progress of which is displayed above). I&#8217;m glad to announce that as of today I&#8217;m am working toward the step of completing the logo and readying the order. This means that I NEED TO KNOW what sizes to order. If you want one of the shirts, please reply with the size you want. And remeber the bigger the order is for me, the cheaper the shirts are for everyone.

I plan on updating this post throughout the day, so be sure to check back later.

And thanks to everyone for their continued support. I really couldn&#8217;t do any of this without you guys.

Sincerely,
