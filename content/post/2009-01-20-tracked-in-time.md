  For anyone who&rsquo;s curious: Yes, I&rsquo;m still using Impulse Tracker to<br /> track &ldquo;normal&rdquo; songs (not just chiptunes) and yes, there&rsquo;s new stuff<br /> you can listen to.

    Some background, for anyone who is scratching their head: I&rsquo;m in a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_group">demo group</a> called <a target="_blank" href="http://brainstorm.untergrund.net/" title="Brainstorm Productions">Brainstorm</a> along with a bunch of incredible musicians, programmers, and artists. We make cool <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_%28computer_programming%29" title="Demo">demos</a> and enter in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint_%28demo_party%29" title="Breakpoint">demo party contests</a> and talk about boobies and human-goat relations and alcoholic beverages.

    A musicdisk is essentially an album or EP of music released for free<br /> in the demo scene, often packaged as an executable file with a display<br /> / visualization program written specifically for the album. Tracked in<br /> Time (TiT for short, obviously) is one such musicdisk, with a very<br /> unique distinction.

    In the late 80s and early 90s, tracking software exploded onto the scene following the release of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Soundtracker">Ultimate Soundtracker</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a><br /> computer in 1987. There was an official disk of instrument / percussion<br /> samples distributed alongside it, called ST-01. We have taken that pack<br /> of samples, and nothing else, and written a collection of brand new<br /> songs.

    This production is many years in the making &mdash; if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar<br /> with musicdisks or demos, you&rsquo;ll want to click on the &ldquo;Info&rdquo; button to<br /> get a scrolling text file while you listen to the songs. It will<br /> explain more about the disk and, at times, the &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo; will be<br /> &ldquo;handed over&rdquo; to each participant, myself included, to say a little<br /> something.

    My tracks are &ldquo;Keep Shreddin&rsquo;, Little Man&rdquo; (4 channel) and<br /> &ldquo;Nightfall over the City&rdquo; (multichannel), but do yourself a favor and<br /> listen to everything; there&rsquo;s a TON of great music in there. Enjoy!
