  Amazing nerdcore artist, not to mention OCRemixer and head of the SF2HD soundtrack, <a href="http://www.shaelriley.com/">Shael Riley</a> has recently informed me that he will be performing live at <a href="http://www.aandgohio.com/">A&G Ohio</a>,<br /> which stands for Animation and Gaming respectively. I have been<br /> watching youtubes of his sets for a while now and they are definitely<br /> not something to be missed.

  Maybe one day he will make it out to the<br /> west coast, or he&#8217;ll have a set at <a href="http://nerdapaloozafest.com/">Nerdapalooza</a><br /> at the least (hear that Hex?). Anyway, check out the convention which<br /> runs March 13-15, as it should be ace. And of course don&#8217;t miss out on<br /> Shael Riley&#8217;s set on Saturday March 14th unless you are a grade A<br /> sucker. For proof check out the footage below of the appropriate for<br /> Valentine&#8217;s Day song Bits and Pieces from his album Toybox!</p>
