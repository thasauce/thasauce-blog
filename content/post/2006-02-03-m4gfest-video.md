For all of you who didn&#8217;t get to take part in all the AWESOME at MAGFest this year, and for all of us who went and still can&#8217;t let go of all those memories we shared (_awwww_), [this video](../../../../undefined/http://www.thasauce.net) was posted over on the MAGFest forums.

Hey guys. This is Chad_W, I was one of the driving forces behind the MAGfest 2.0 documentary (along with Juese and others from X-Strike Studios).</p> 

I&#8217;d like to announce that while a full-blown doc wasn&#8217;t possible this year, I still shot/borrowed enough to make a two minute run-down of this year&#8217;s insanely awesome fest &#8211; featuring the music from the super rocking Sprite Slowdown.

It includes such memoriable moments as Virt&#8217;s Panel, a few of mv&#8217;s **many** hugs (Shael included), & Devon&#8217;s Little Mac cosplay. It also has moments with both Rail **and** Koala (which I&#8217;m sure Shael could [probably](http://lobachevsky.homelinux.net/%7Esriley/Original/Shael%20Riley%20-%20Less%20Than%20Three.mp3) [appreciate](http://lobachevsky.homelinux.net/%7Esriley/Toybox/Final/02%20-%20Love%20me%20Koala.mp3)), and pictures of D-Lux, pixitricks, (_dbl-awww_) & Moguta.
