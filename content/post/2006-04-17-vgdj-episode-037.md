This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):

_&#8220;Out with the old, in with the new! It&#8217;s springtime, and OCR and VGDJ alike are busting out some fresh site designs. (Except we spared you the sidebar&#8230; this time&#8230;) A thousand thanks to Cyan_Ide for his amazing work! SgtRama&#8217;s back like Jack, we&#8217;ve got Chrono plus crazy rap, and I suck at free-styling, but put on your&#8230;cap? Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll get it when you hear this week&#8217;s jollly good show. Score one for pixietricks!&#8221;</p>
