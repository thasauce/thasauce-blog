> Hyadain, whose work originally debuted in 2008, has been known for creative remixes of famous game music, adding clever, generally humorous vocals and jokes about the game. Earlier this week he <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ameblo.jp/hyadain/entry-10525309013.html" title="" target="_blank">revealed</a>his identity to the world, showcasing some of his professional work including the 11th opening to the long-running anime _One Piece_.

Some of his songs, such as hisï¿½<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSXr99WhxDo" title="" target="_blank">remix</a>ï¿½of the mainï¿½_Final Fantasy_ï¿½theme, showcased rather complex vocal work that your average fan isn&#8217;t going to be capable of performing.
