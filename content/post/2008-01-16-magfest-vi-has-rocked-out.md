  Thanks to all who were at MAGFest VI! This one rocked as hard as any<br /> other, and was so smooth overall that the hotel staff complimented us<br /> on how polite the group was!
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  There were a few incidents, and to keep the rumor mill under control, I&#8217;ll lay out the basics of the major ones:</p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8211; Hotel vandalism: a few lampshades, phones, and fire<br /> extinguishers were damaged. The people responsible for the room where<br /> the damaged stuff ended up were removed from the hotel, as well as one<br /> other person partly responsible for the vandalism itself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; Someone entered the concert without a badge, and when security<br /> stopped him, he ran past them into the concert again. Rumor note: he<br /> was not kicked out for crowd surfing. Crowd surfing has not been<br /> allowed at MAGFest for the last 2 years because of safety and liability<br /> concerns, like expensive low-hanging chandeliers, but we would not kick<br /> anyone out for it. We just pull them down off the crowd and ask them<br /> not to do it again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; Assault, with riot cops: This one generated the most stories.<br /> Yes, there were heavily armed cops. No, it wasn&#8217;t a big deal. It was an<br /> over-reaction by the police to a 911 call for a simple punch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; Fire alarm: A pipe burst in the garage, and triggered a water<br /> pressure alarm related to the sprinkler system. It had nothing to do<br /> with MAGFest, but it did get us all outside for a few minutes. =]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Everyone involved with any of these above mentioned incidents was<br /> impressively cool about it, and most will be welcomed back next year.<br /> Please contact us if you have a question about your status with MAGFest.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyone who would like to send a note of thanks to the Hilton, or the<br /> Dorsai Irregulars (our volunteer security group) please use the contact<br /> link on the left. We will be compiling these notes and sending along<br /> one big letter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This year went so smoothly that next year&#8217;s dates may be confirmed in the next week or 2. Check back here soon!
