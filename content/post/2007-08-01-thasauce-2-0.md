<img border="0" align="left" src="images/articlesplash/nuke-ball.png" />We&#8217;re finally live. It&#8217;s not as drastic a change as I would&#8217;ve liked, but only because we&#8217;ve slowly rolled in these features over the last 6 months or so. Drastically new are the Tags module, which lets you tag any story, and the new front page, which is more news-site-ish. As you can see below we&#8217;re still adding some dynamic multimedia content, and we&#8217;re also tweaking the theme to fit the new features.
  
Coming up soon we&#8217;ll have new userpages, _finally_ finish the forums-based comments system, clean up the news submission process (the one thing I haven&#8217;t touched at ALL, because the existing code is the worst thing imaginable) and hopefully find a way to get Multiheadlines up again (which isn&#8217;t able to update due to a change in the server config made by the host, which we can&#8217;t override).

The [Feedback forum](http://forums.thasauce.net/viewforum.php?f=19) is now open for news discussion as well, so you can put ideas and questions about news stories there. I&#8217;ve also put up some <a href="http://forums.thasauce.net/viewtopic.php?p=3730#3730" target="_blank">News Style Guidelines</a>.

So, get out there and tag some articles.
