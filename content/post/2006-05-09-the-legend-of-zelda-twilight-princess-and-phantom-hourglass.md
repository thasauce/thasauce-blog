Big news from the world of Nintendo!

On launch day for the Nintendo Wii, there will be two Twilight Princess releases. First, the Wii&#8217;s version, obviously a souped up version to test the limits of their graphics processors. AND!!!! A GCN version for those who wish to play it without having to shell out cash for the Wii.
  
Its gonna be HUGE!

Also, a new upcoming title, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS!

There are 27 titles so far for the Wii&#8217;s Launch Day, which remains a mystery as of right now. For now, here&#8217;s a short list of whats coming from Nintendo&#8230;

Red Steel (features gun battles and sword battles)  
Project H.A.M.M.E.R.  
Super Mario Galaxy  
Metroid Prime 3: Coruption (very much anticipated)  
Disaster: Day of Crisis (little is known about this)

More are on-the-way. But this is just a taste to whet your appetite.

Stay tuned!
