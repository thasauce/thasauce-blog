<a href="http://www.tindeck.com/down.html" target="_blank">Tindeck, a popular MP3 hosting website</a> used by many members of the community, has recently announced that they were be out of commission for the remainder of the month due to bandwidth issues:

    <strong>Tindeck is down until next month. &#8211; 15/Jan/2009 02:17</strong>

    We got fucked hard by people uploading copyrighted material (primarily<br /> Britney Spears and Akon; can&#8217;t say we&#8217;re terribly surprised) and<br /> hotlinking those files on MySpace profiles and through various<br /> streaming sites. The amount of bandwidth we used is shocking and more<br /> expensive than we can afford at this time, so until our metrics reset<br /> Tindeck will be kept offline to avoid running the bill up even further.

  Tindeck has never been a profit-generating service (in actual fact we<br /> pay a lot of money out of our own pockets each month to keep this place<br /> going) so the abuse of what we provide here is really disheartening,<br /> particularly given the amount of debt it&#8217;s driven us into :(The files already uploaded are all safe and sound, and we&#8217;ll be back to<br /> normal operation next month with a few new features and a redesign that<br /> will make things a hell of a lot easier to manage.<strong>Â </strong>
