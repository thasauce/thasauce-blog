  Well, VacUm from Neskvartten (with all his jazz remixes) has created a site (aka his pet project), <a href="http://www.damnsuckers.com/" target="_blank">http//www.damnsuckers.com</a>.</p> 
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s cool definitely, and I believe it will be used to have the community interact more. It&#8217;s definitely something.
