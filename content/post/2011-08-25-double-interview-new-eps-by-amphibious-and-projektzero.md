I recently got the chance to interview Amphibious and ProjektZero about their respective EP releases: [_Oceans_](http://amphibious.bandcamp.com/album/oceans-ep) and [_Getting to Know You_](http://projektzero.bandcamp.com/album/Getting-to-Know-You). Both artists have associations with the arrangement community, so I asked them each about the stories behind the making of their tracks, their influences and how creative competitions have affected their work.

  <strong>Amphibious â€“ <em>Oceans EP</em></strong>
</p>

Amphibious has gained a reputation for creating ambient, chilled music with fluid movement. To that end, his release _Oceans_ is a concept EP, specifically referencing a journey through the sea as a topic. Amphibious explained his motivations for exploring a musical narrative. â€œI&#8217;ve always been told my songs remind people of water for some reason, and the ideas I came up with definitely had that vibe, so I decided to add a theme to my EP. It also sort of fits with the name Amphibious, which is cool too.â€

Work on the album began in early June and continued over the summer. He stated that, â€œI&#8217;d been experimenting with music a lot over the last year or so. I got Komplete in May for my birthday, and I spent a few weeks learning the various things in the package. But for the most part, the songs I started never did get finished. One of my roommates and I were talking about how I didn&#8217;t really see many through to the end, so I decided I&#8217;d take this summer as an opportunity to change that. I sat down and got some ideas ready. That is when I started to work on my new songs for the EP.â€

[Meteo Xavier](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/meteo-xavier/) contributed the EPâ€™s artwork. Amphibious initially created a cover image himself, and related an anecdote to that effect: â€œI knew my artwork was bad when I originally made it, but I figured something quick and shoddy would be better than nothing. I got a few comments on [OC ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) about how bad it was; Meteo in particular wanted to redo it himself and I guess he decided to whip something up quick. I&#8217;m really happy with it, he did it pretty quickly but itâ€™s infinitely better than what I had before.Â  Many thanks to him.â€

When asked about the contributing factors to his musical style, Amphibious noted that â€œThis particular album had a lot of influence from David Arkenstone. He did a lot of world and Celtic music such as the tavern music _in World of Warcraft_, but he released a chillout album that I absolutely love. â€˜Plungeâ€™ in particular draws influence from that.Â  I would also say the _Metroid Prime_ soundtrack has had some influence on me as well.â€

The track â€œPelagic Fortressâ€ on the EP started off as an entry for a composition competition. Â Amphibious shared his thoughts on time-constrained musical gatherings: â€œWhen I first heard about compo, it seemed like a cool idea, but [two hours](http://compo.jhsounds.com/) sounded so short.Â  However once I tried it, I was pretty amazed at what I could come up with in such a short time frame. â€˜Pelagic Fortressâ€™ in particular fit the theme of my album very well. Overall the compos definitely have helped me with efficiency. And having a theme given to you is sometimes a helpful way to come up with new ideas.â€

_Oceans EP_ is currently [available at Bandcamp](http://amphibious.bandcamp.com/) for free, or pay-what-you-want pricing. Amphibious is pleased with the response to the release, noting that â€œI&#8217;d still consider myself a bit of an amateur, and there have been some fair criticisms, but some people have really enjoyed my stuff and I&#8217;m very pleased with that.â€

  <strong>ProjektZero â€“ <em>Getting to Know You</em></strong>
</p>

Matt â€œProjektZeroâ€ Rittinghouse identifies with the nerdcore scene, though his music has recently gravitated away from his rap roots and toward groove-based, melodic pop songwriting. His EP carries a unifying concept, as he expressed that â€œthe theme with _Getting to Know You_ is that I wanted each song to provide some glimpse at me as a person, or the things I feel. â€˜Loop Onâ€™ deals with relationships; â€˜331â€™ and â€˜Mannequinsâ€™ deal with friendships and isolation; â€˜The Standâ€™ deals with my geekier tendencies; and â€˜Fake Itâ€™ deals with this sort of transition out from my teenage years.â€

[Untested Methods](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Untested-Methods/200398176654002) and [zircon](http://ocremix.org/artist/4628/zircon) are credited with mixing on specific tracks. Matt explained how these collaborations came about: â€œI met Eric (Methods) at Nerdapalooza 2010. I&#8217;m a huge fan of a lot of his remixes, but I&#8217;m probably a bigger fan of the chiptune-infused synthpop style he has developed in his independent work. He and I are both music production geeks that use FL Studio, so we&#8217;ve been chatting fairly regularly since Nerdapalooza, and we&#8217;ve tried several efforts at collaboration along the way. This was just the first one that made it to a finalized, published product.â€

Matt considers zircon and the OC ReMix community to be a great motivation and influence on his production. He elaborated on zirconâ€™s contribution to the EP: â€œI&#8217;ve had zircon on my contacts list since he did a series of FL Studio production tutorials a few years back. I had been struggling very, very hard to mix â€˜The Standâ€™. I&#8217;d worked on it for eight hours a day, for three days straight, and had finally just fallen into despair over mixing the song. So I shot zircon a message, and he graciously offered to help me out. He pretty much saved that track from falling apart.â€

_Getting to Know You_ includes a cover version of a song by [Brad Turcotte](http://www.bradsucks.net/) called â€œFake Itâ€. Matt expressed his desire was to cover this song, and include it on the EP. â€œThrough my old school nerdcore ways, I&#8217;m hip to a place called SongFight, where Brad is a regular competitor. I feel like I&#8217;m a broken record for saying it, but I&#8217;m a huge fan of his work, and his entire album _Out of It_ is absolutely classic to me. I specifically chose â€˜Fake Itâ€™ because I felt like it sort of encapsulated the changes that I went through in college. I think that song feels like every twenty-something&#8217;s anthem.â€

JG Hollowell, also known as Mithurn, provided the second rhythm guitar heard on â€œLoop Onâ€. Matt talked about how they both became acquainted: â€œJG is an old, old friend of mine. Probably since before I started making music, or at least somewhere around that time frame. I met him through an MMO, but it just so happened that he lived in Charleston close to me. I went off to college, but met back up with him shortly after I graduated.â€ Matt also remarked on their collaborative process by saying that, â€œHe presents a whole different dynamic to songwriting when I work with him. I can&#8217;t just fall back into sequencing; I have to work live. I&#8217;m playing guitar and singing, trying to come up with melodies or chords on the spot. He has a lot more of a free jam session background, and I strongly respect that. â€˜Loop Onâ€™ evolved from a jam between us.â€

The track â€œMannequinsâ€ on the EP originated as a track ProjektZero made for a compo. Matt expressed his thoughts on the composition competition experience, statingÂ  â€œI absolutely feel that the compos benefited me. I&#8217;ve put out six albums since I&#8217;ve started doing them. Of course, most of those directly came from the compos. This new EP is more refined, but it wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the compo experience. The advice and the high pressure trial-and-error was just invaluable to shaping my songwriting.â€ He agreed that the mannequin concept from [One Hour Compo](http://compo.thasauce.net/compos/view/OHC) was somewhat unusual, but felt that â€œthat&#8217;s what was liberating about it. I couldn&#8217;t get lost in the theme, specifically because it was obscure. So to really thrive with mannequins as a concept, you had to make it your own. And I think that&#8217;s what made that week&#8217;s theme probably my favorite one of the entire series so far.â€

_Getting to Know You_ is [available now](http://projektzero.bandcamp.com/) at Bandcamp with free or name-your-price options. The cover art was created by Brett Houston.
