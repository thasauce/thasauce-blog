The hip-hop duo Atmosphere has released a full-length free CD for Christmas. Atmosphere has become arguably one of the most successful hip hop groups over the year, founding the Rhymesayers record label which has signed artists such as P.O.S., I Self Define, and MF Doom.
  
This isn&#8217;t some 3rd rate internet recording, either. This is the real deal quality hip hop. Over the years Atmosphere has become my single most listened to band, so it&#8217;s obvious that I thoroughly recommend it.
