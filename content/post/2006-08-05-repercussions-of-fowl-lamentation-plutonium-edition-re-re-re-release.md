After countless requests to put the torrent back up, I&#8217;ve FINALLY decided to RE-RELEASE the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repercussions_of_Fowl_Lamentation" target="_blank">RoFL: Plutonium Edition</a> for the Xth time. 
  
Though the original Plutonium Edition released after the April 1st joke was lost in a hard drive crash, I did my best to re-compile this one as best I can. This version contains all 35 original tracks AND AntonioPizza&#8217;s track for the re-release version, &#8220;Skeetin&#8217; On a Cell Phone.&#8221; It also has way cleaner tags and filenames than the original release.

So enough talk, go download it @:
