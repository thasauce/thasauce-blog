JustÂ receivedÂ word from our friends over at [Ubiktune](http://ubiktune.org/) that Ken &#8220;coda&#8221; Snyder, one halfÂ of[Â yogurtboxÂ ](http://yogurtbox.com/)duoÂ (along with theÂ [recently discussedÂ ](http://thasauce.net/2012/04/21/quick-look-aivi-surasshus-mabe-village-collaboration/)Steven &#8220;surasshu&#8221; Velema) that are known for last year&#8217;sÂ _[Tree of Knowledge](http://yogurtbox.bandcamp.com/)Â _album, will be releasing his solo debut album _tracer_Â within the week:

> As weÂ [previously announced](http://ubiktune.org/news/2012/coda-of-yogurtbox-to-release-tracer-on-may-3), a new debut albumÂ _tracer_Â by coda ofÂ [yogurtbox](http://ubiktune.org/releases/ubi024-yogurtbox-tree-of-knowledge)Â fame will be released on May 3. This album will be released as &#8216;pay-what-you-want&#8217; and will be available right after theÂ [Noise Channel](http://noisechanradio.com/)Â listening party. Noise Channel listeners will be the first to hear the album from start to finish and then download it immediately afterwards.
> 
> Be sure to join the party and get in on the chat with coda and the other listeners over atÂ [Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/). Start time is 10PM Eastern, 7PM Pacific, 6AM Moscow time or May 4th noon for JST. More details are revealed over at theÂ [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/249961458432592/).

coda&#8217;s EPÂ will consist of four tracks that promise a &#8220;half hour of chiptune-infused prog rock madness&#8221;. Viewing the trailer above, we feel inclined to agree with this statement and are excited to listen to his fascinating interpretation of chiptunes, which definitely strays away from any traditional chip music we have ever heard. Be sure to head over to [Ubiktune](http://ubiktune.org/) or [yogurtbox&#8217;s Bandcamp](http://yogurtbox.bandcamp.com/) for _tracer_ this Thursday,Â May 3rd.
