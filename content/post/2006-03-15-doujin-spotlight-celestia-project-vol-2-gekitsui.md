March 12th saw the release of two doujin events: <a href="http://www.celestia-project.info/sb/sb.cgi?cid=23" target="_blank">Celestia Project Vol. 2 ~ Jazz Festival</a> and the third <a href="http://www.gekitsui.net/" target="_blank">&#25731;&#22684;&#29579;&#27770;&#23450;&#25126;</a> (roughly &#8220;Gekitsui King Contest&#8221;, I think), a VG rock arrangement competition.

(\*obligatory Babelfish/Google Translate warning\*)
  
Celestia Project Vol. 2, as you can probably guess, is the followup to <a href="modules.php?name=News&#038;file=article&#038;sid=159" target="_blank">Celestia Project Vol. 1</a>, which consisted completely of Square/Enix arrangements and was a massive success with over 80 submissions. Unfortunately, to say that Vol. 2 does not live up to its predecessor is more than an understatement. There were no game restrictions this time around, but all submissions were required to be in a jazz style. There was a disappointing total of 12 video game arrangements, of which roughly half are even listenable (no offense to any contributors who might be reading this). However, the project is perhaps saved by its other half: a collection of 10 original pieces also in jazz style. I personally recommend the ones by millstones, YK, and Tadasuke in particular. The theme for Vol. 3 is as yet undecided.

Gekitsui, on the other hand, with its heavy metal/rock theme, is a real treat for any VGM fan. One might compare this event to a Dwelling of Duels free month uber-competition. Now in its third iteration, original submissions were welcomed this time as well. Coming in at <a href="http://www.gekitsui.net/030/" target="_blank">44 VG arrangements</a> and <a href="http://www.gekitsui.net/040/" target="_blank">24 original tracks</a> for a total of 68 submissions, Gekitsui rivals the success of the Celestia Project Vol. 1. In this tribute to the mighty axe, there is plenty of distortion, overdrive, and wah-wah for all. Voting is being held until the 19th, although I haven&#8217;t been able to determine exactly how to actually vote. Results will be announced a week later, on the 26th.
