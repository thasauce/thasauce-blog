_**[The following is an April Fools&#8217; Joke and is satirical in nature. None of it should be taken seriously EXCEPT the launch of VGMix Archive, which is an actual website that serves it&#8217;s advertised purpose.]**_

After an unfortunate turn of events we regret to announce that ThaSauce has ended our relationship with OverClocked ReMix indefinitely, active immediately. This is a really sad day for all of us, but after months of discussion andÂ preparation, we have to call it off. Negotiations broke down soon after our announcement after we reachedÂ unresolvedÂ circumstances between ourselves and the OverClocked ReMix staff, particlarly Stevo &#8220;Level99&#8221; Bortz.

Things aren&#8217;t all bad, though. As we realized we were reaching an impasse we began exploring our otherÂ partnershipÂ options. With that said, we are now proud to announced new relationship between ThaSauce and Jake &#8220;vert&#8221; Kaufman and his VGMix team. Jake has been very understanding of the circumstances between us and OCReMix, and as a result we have decided to join forces to make the best online community that video game arrangements have ever seen!

As a celebration of our new, hopefully long-lasting,Â partnershipÂ we are proud to announce the launch of [VGMix Archive](http://vgmixarchive.com). VGMix Archive is a large, searchable index of every VGMix 1, 2, and X song we could pull together. Preview and download your favorite tracks, or download the whole collection via BitTorrent! We hope to keep VGMix Archive a constantly updating archive, so anyone who has any tracks that we might be missing, feel free to let us know!

We apologize for all the preceding drama, but we are dedicated to moving forward and making the internet a better place one video game remix at a time, no matter how many beards try to stand in our way!
