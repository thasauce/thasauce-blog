  VGDJ&#8217;s 1st anniversary will take place on May 22nd, 2006. In order to properly celebrate the occassion, hosts zircon and pixietricks will be holding a meet-up in Philadelphia, PA on Saturday, May 20th. The plan is to meet up at the Philadelphia City Hall around 12PM and as zircon says, &#8220;and then merriment will commence when we&#8217;re all there.&#8221; There are also plans to record a &#8220;live&#8221; VGDJ show as well.</p>
