A month ago I mentioned about &#8220;PLAY a VGM movie&#8221;. Their aim with that project was showing the public that video game music is more than just exciting remakes of game melodies for the &#8220;NERDS&#8221;.
  
Here&#8217;s some video that they&#8217;ve produced thus far! (starring Animal
  
Style and Nullsleep). <strike>[Click here]() </strike>to see the movie on youtubeNews.
