Larry threw everyone a curve ball last night when he announced a **live <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/forum_viewtopic.php?18.12054" target="_self">VGF 61</a>**. Apparently he&#8217;s recently moved to the Atlanta area and will be using his alumni status to extend the shows life for _at least_ another semester.
  
It didn&#8217;t take long for VGF to get back into the swing of things, with
  
pre-show calls from Flik, during-show calls from Fusion & myself,
  
as well as others like Shael and joecam. Not to mention all the &#8220;yea
  
bro&#8221;s, &#8220;that&#8217;s hot&#8221;s, and all the other Larry-isms we&#8217;ve all come to
  
love.

Needless to say, everyone is glad to see the show back and here&#8217;s to a new, and even more stellar season, of VGF!
