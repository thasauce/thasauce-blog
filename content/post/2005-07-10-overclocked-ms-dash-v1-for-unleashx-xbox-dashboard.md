<span class="postbody">So yea, there&#8217;s MAYBE a handful of people here<br /> with modded XBOXes, and even less of them probably use UnleashX as a<br /> dash, BUT I&#8217;m gonna release this on a few XBOX community sites and I<br /> figured it&#8217;d only be fitting to do it here first&#8230;</span>

  Still some work to do, some cleaning up and what not, but that&#8217;s why this is version 1 =P.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway it won&#8217;t look all blurry and sharp in places on a NORMAL TV,<br /> that&#8217;s just the direct screen rip from the XBOX. I&#8217;m not sure how it&#8217;ll<br /> look on an HD or widescreen or anything like that, BUT that what the<br /> cleaning is for =P.
</p>

<p>
  Also: The whole thing isn&#8217;t all that dark, either.
</p>

<p>
  So for anyone who&#8217;s interested:
