Our longest episode yet, this special edition of VGDJ brings you a
  
behind-the-scenes look at Video Games Live! Besides a sizable amount of
  
ReMix Reviews, aided by the Pretz himself, we managed to snag
  
interviews with six (!) of the composers and performers involved in the
  
concert, including mister Tommy Tallarico, of course. Even without our
  
standard reports, there&#8217;s more video game music material here than you
  
can shake a stick at, so ya&#8217;ll would be nuts not to check this one out!
  
[ENJOY!](http://www.vgdj.net/Shows/VGDJ_ep_043.mp3)
  
[00:00] Darkesword hookin&#8217; us up with the speech synth/beatbox action. Phat! Get ready for the longest show evaaaarrrrr.  
[01:08] This week&#8217;s show was recorded in a variety of locations, but we started in the dressing rooms backstage at [Video Games Live](http://www.videogameslive.com/) accompanied by djpretzel. Anyway, there&#8217;s a lot of podcast to be podcasted, so before you begin, [drop us a vote at podcastalley](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140).  
[03:43] ReMix Review: From [Ghouls &#8216;N Ghosts](http://www.ocremix.org/game/ghoulsnghostsc64/): &#8216;[Poltergeist Mix](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01478/)&#8216; by [binster](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/binster/)
  
&#8230; A tasty combination of classic synth sounds and cutting-edge ones
  
on top of an awesome beat. All three of us were diggin&#8217; this.  
[06:04] ReMix Review: From [Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo](http://www.ocremix.org/game/ssf2t/): &#8216;[New Mexican Thunderbird](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01479/)&#8216; by [Vurez](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/vurez/)
  
&#8230; It might not be very urban in the traditional sense, but this very
  
unique remix certainly deserves it&#8217;s spot on the Blood on the Asphalt
  
remix project.  
[09:16] ReMix Review: From [Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo](http://www.ocremix.org/game/ssf2t/): &#8216;[Flying Heaven](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01480/)&#8216; by [zircon](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/zircon/)
  
&#8230; Yes. YES. You might not think ethnic instruments and slammin&#8217;
  
breakbeats would combine well, but as demonstrated by this mix, they
  
most certainly do.  
[12:07] ReMix Review: From [Raptor](http://www.ocremix.org/game/raptor/): &#8216;[PlectraSubCity](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01481/)&#8216; by [TO](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/to/)
  
&#8230; Smooth, ambient material in this one. pixietricks was swooning over
  
TO&#8217;s vocals, which were the high point of this solid remix.  
[15:31] Co-composer for Halo and Halo 2 [Michael Salvatori](http://www.ocremix.org/composer/id/353/) grants us an interview telling about his experience writing for one of the most popular franchises of all time.   
[23:39] The video game pianist [Martin Leung](http://www.videogamepianist.com/)
  
showed up at VGL, much to the delight of everyone attending, and gave
  
us an interview too! If you haven&#8217;t seen this blindfolded,
  
Mario-playing dude, you must be living under a rock. Great to meet you,
  
Martin!  
[28:47] [Gerard Marino](http://gerardkmarino.com/),
  
the lead composer for God of War and it&#8217;s in-development sequel, gives
  
us his thoughts on the state of video game music today, as well as his
  
own experience working on an epic soundtrack.  
[38:15]
  
It&#8217;s not just about the orchestral music! Marcus Henderson, the primary
  
player for Guitar Hero and the upcoming sequel, was happy to talk with
  
us. Rock on, dude, rock on.   
[44:00] Composer, conductor.. remixer? Composer [Jack Wall](http://www.jackwall.net/) had a lot to say about his work for the Myst series, his upcoming projects, and more.  
[53:28] [Tommy Tallarico](http://tallarico.com/index.php?s=home);
  
does this legendary American vgm composer really need an introduction?
  
We sat down with him for a bit and got a nice, full-length interview.
  
But that&#8217;s not all. He also helped with&#8230;  
[70:38] Russian ReMix Roulette:
  
Before the epic, heavy-metal rolling of the die, Tommy gives us an
  
exclusive about an upcoming project &#8211; listen closely, because it&#8217;s
  
awesome! Anyway, while an Earthworm Jim remix was on the list, double
  
T&#8217;s dare-devil, heavy metal roll landed on [Wizards and Warriors](http://www.ocremix.org/game/wizardsandwarriors/): &#8216;[Theme](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01034/)&#8216; by [bazooie](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/bazooie/).  
[75:45] We
  
are left with an inspirational message to the members of the OCR
  
community, and a prediction about the future of video game music that
  
we certainly hope is going to come true. Thanks, Tommy!  
[79:09]
  
We&#8217;re at the meet and greet right after VGL with Merk, Atma Weapon,
  
Steve (D-Lux), and Moguta who all tell us what they thought of the
  
show. Believe it or not, the line to meet all the composers (and djp)
  
was so long that not even everyone got to get autographs before the
  
theatre closed. Video game music unpopular? Not today! XD  
[81:10]
  
Phew! What a day, and what an episode. We have nothing but love for the
  
people who put Video Games Live together &#8211; thanks for all the
  
interviews. Check out all the pics in our [Action Shot Photo Album](http://www.vgdj.net/album),
  
starting on page 5! Also, Paul & Paul were there the whole time
  
picking up some great footage, so don&#8217;t forget to check their site for
  
news on their upcoming [video game music documentary](http://myspace.com/vgmmovie). Now, after hearing all that, surely you&#8217;ve [voted for us](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140) by now&#8230; right? We loooooove youuuuuu&#8230;
