    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <strong><a href="http://thasauce.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/phpThumb_generated_thumbnailjpg.jpg"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DISC 1</strong></span> </span></a></strong></strong></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Fishy &#8211; Game On (~Opening~ Demo) 0:19</span><br /> Starts out with the Game Freak sound effects, and then rocks the main theme like mad!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Level 99 &#8211; The Mighty Mighty PokÃ©mon (~Opening~ Demo 2) 2:48</span><br /> Starts out with Stevo&#8217;s signature guitar sound! Pretty rockin&#8217; track from the start. 0:30 shows off some source usage. 1:08 brings a breakdown&#8230; and then it builds back up without missing a beat. 1:31 brings in a solo. Source resumes at 2:01. Stevo rocks this track right to the very end! YEAH!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. halc &#8211; Shades of Red (Theme of Pallet Town) 3:11</span><br /> I thought this was a remix album&#8230; not a soundtrack. Starts out with almost straight source usage, and 0:18 brings in the remix. halc keeps on improving his skills! 1:25 brings in some solo action. 1:44 slows it down and breaks it down. Source returns with some mixage at 1:54. Everything slows down at 2:30. It all starts to fade away at this point as well&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Jaroban, Matt Beckemeyer, Fishy, Sam Cooper, Vralia, Jocelyn Holst, DJ Krisp-E, Chris Stibrany &#8211; My Greatest Rival (Battle! Rival) 5:28</span><br /> Oooh! Starts out pretty ominous sounding&#8230; Also, it didn&#8217;t take long to get to the requisite mega-collab. 0:13 brings in guitar, and 0:20 brings in an epic voiceover. 0:36 shows source chippiness. Vocal track? No worries, the lyrics are pretty well written, and also pretty funny. 1:25 brings in a backup vocal. That&#8217;s great&#8230; We&#8217;ll see who has the bigger PokÃ©balls! Best line ever. This makes Gold out to be a loser of sorts and Silver to be a pimp. Then again, Silver is Giovanni&#8217;s&#8230; err&#8230; don&#8217;t want to spoil that. 2:50 or so brings in the chorus. 3:22 brings a breakdown of sorts. Whip out your PokÃ©balls! 3:37 or so brings in a battle scene voiceover with classic sound effects. The lyrics don&#8217;t take themselves seriously at all&#8230; I love it. 4:20 brings the chorus back. 4:58 ends the song, and ambience starts until the end, with the epic voiceover too&#8230; What a hilarious track.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. ProtoDome &#8211; Rain Prayer (Road to Viridian City &#8211; From Pallet ~ Guidepost ~ Road to Cerulean &#8211; From Mt. Moon) 2:42</span><br /> Piano, eh? Proto&#8217;s still got it. But why isn&#8217;t he saving Christmas: The Dangerous Formula? Eh, no matter&#8230; 0:22 brings in some chippiness with the piano. What a mellow jazzy track&#8230; This is a really good track right here; I love it! 1:25 or so brings in a piano solo. 1:38 brings in a chippy solo. Everything really picks up at 2:04 or so. Everything fades away at 2:36.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. prophetik &#8211; Viridian Vibe (Theme of Pewter City) 3:29</span><br /> Ambience, eh? Saxophone at 0:16 or so. Some electronica comes in at 0:38 or so. This is a beautiful track right here&#8230; 1:24 brings in a solo of the wind instrument. Source resumes at 1:50. The electronic sound in the background works beautifully. It keeps the track together in a cohesive unit. More solo at 2:38 or so. The finale becomes evident at 2:58. Ambience returns at 3:10, and the sax fades out to the end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. Cerrax &#8211; Out of Antidote (Viridian Forest) 3:41</span><br /> Eh, eh? Okay, I had to do that. 0:08 brings in source, with creepiness to boot. This is how this track should be done! After all, they say that the forest is a maze. Great work from Cerrax here. What an eerie track; fitting for this creepy forest. 1:06 brings in some more creepy ambience, and is followed by a solo. There&#8217;s even more creepiness at 1:30!! Everything slows down and calms down at 1:45 or so, but builds back up 10 seconds later. Another solo of sorts at 2:10, with a breakdown included. It slowly builds up to what is sure to be an epic finale. A hint of the end at 2:48. 3:04 brings a return of the norm, but with a hint of finality. 3:26 proves that the end is near, and it breaks down to the end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. ProtoDome, Level 99 &#8211; Hope to See You Again Soon&#8230; (PokÃ©mon Center) 2:21</span><br /> A mellow mix for a mellow source. With &#8220;duh duh duh nuh nuh&#8221;s included. Looks like Stevo opted for acoustic here, and Proto opted for his usual quirkiness. A breakdown at 1:20 or so. The piano in the background is beautiful. 1:50 brings a solo of sorts. Fades to end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. Fishy &#8211; Battle for the Badge [Battle (VS Gym Leader)] 4:10</span><br /> Starts out calm, but 0:05 brings in some epic music. 0:16 shows the source in full rockin&#8217; glory! 0:37 rocks it even harder. Distortion at 0:58. This is a phenomenal track right here&#8230; just what a remix of this source should be and more! It&#8217;s hard to review because it&#8217;s so awesome. I only want to listen and not type! Woe&#8230; Anywho, 1:57 kicks off the solo; can&#8217;t miss that now can we? 2:17 brings in more of the solo, and it sure sounds epic. Source begins to return at 3:00 or so. Still a bit of a solo here&#8230; that&#8217;s over a minute now. Slowdown at 3:29. Calm music until the end&#8230; One hell of a track there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. ProtoDome &#8211; On the Origin of Species (Evolution) 1:35</span><br /> This title makes me laugh&#8230; well done, Proto. Well done. A mellow track for a simple source. Nice breakdowns and usage of PokÃ©mon cries. Yes, I can tell they&#8217;re cries by the sound. Yes, I&#8217;m a nerd. No I don&#8217;t care. Think I heard a Magnemite in there&#8230; Very well done, and very calm. Nice work. Ends with the classic finished sound.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">11. Benjamin Briggs &#8211; Drowning Blue (S.S. Anne) 3:13</span><br /> Piano/chiptune hybrid is evident in the first 20 seconds. Classic chthonic goodness here. 0:56 brings in some source usage. Slowdown at 1:22, and solo from there. Slight speedup at 1:44 or so. It works wonderfully. Also a bit of a solo at this point, until 2:27 when the source returns. Fadeaway at 2:54 to end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12. Rozovian &#8211; Spume (Sea) 4:43</span><br /> Oh, Rozo, what have you done here? Let&#8217;s see! Sonar blips? Nice ambience&#8230; signature for Rozovian. Everything keeps building and building up until 1:11 when more ambience comes in. What a buildup.. 1:26 brings in some source usage. I knew it was building to something! What a happy track! Scratch that, what a bipolar track. More so than Bipolar Bird from <a title="It's a great album; wait until Lime of the Season comes out!" href="http://essenceoflime.revasser.net/">Essence of Lime</a>&#8230; 2:12 brings in more source usage. 3:07 slows everything down, and brings back the sonar blips. 3:18 brings it all back again though. I like the tempo of this&#8230; Everything slows down for the last minute, and returns to the ambient beginnings of the track. Nice job, man!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">13. Tweek &#8211; TEEM.ROKIT (Team Rocket Hideout) 4:31</span><br /> Tweek, master of epic stuff, tackles the Team Rocket Hideout on his own. Err&#8230; the song, not the place. 0:20 proves the epicity of the track is easily evident. 0:44 brings in some heavy drums. What an epic track! No surprise though; it is Tweek. 1:14 or so brings a breakdown, but with all breakdowns it builds back up. Source usage is littered throughout this breakdown. 2:10 brings in some more solid source usage. 2:26 has the classic sound of the source that is probably ingrained in the memories of youth who played Red and Blue for hours on end. Gold and Silver too, for that matter. 3:00 or so shows another solo. If Team Rocket was this awesome, they just might have succeeded in their goals. Instead, they were foiled by a sixth grader. 3:50 shows that source one last time. Fades to end starting at 4:10.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14. pu_freak &#8211; Clash of the Titans [Battle (VS Trainer)] 5:55</span><br /> Piano rendition of the battle theme? I&#8217;ll take it. 0:26 brings in some source usage. The original battle themes were the best. This is a pretty awesome track. On par with Rexy&#8217;s best, methinks. 1:15 or so is a bit of a solo. 1:30 brings in the source again. Speed up at 1:55 with more source. This style fits the source wonderfully&#8230; like a skintight bodysuit or something. Yeah, it&#8217;s that good of a fit. 2:50 or so has a slowdown, but 3:00 brings in more of the source. 3:25 or so breaks everything down to the simplest form&#8230; pure, slow piano at its best. This continues until 4:24 or so when it starts to build back up&#8230; slowly but surely the intensity increases with each key, each note, until 4:52 when it gets back to the source. And at 5:10 it is on the verge of exploding with the pressure and intensity. At 5:30 it explodes, and the remnants of the track fade away to the finish. Beautiful!! Bravo!!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">15. Rozovian, WillRock &#8211; Blue Haze (Road to Viridian City &#8211; From Pallet) 5:21</span><br /> Once again, ambience. This is also Will&#8217;s first track on the album, and his signature synth sound comes in at 0:48. This track keeps on building like so many others before it. Then again, that&#8217;s fitting for a PokÃ©mon remix album. Have to build your monsters up too, right? 1:38 continues the building of the track&#8230; WillRock uses Source! It&#8217;s super effective! Listener takes 2:10 damage because that&#8217;s the time it begins at. 2:37 brings a hint of more to come. The title is apt; there&#8217;s certainly a haze in my ears with this song. And then at 3:00 or so, the main song cuts through the haze like a Razor Leaf. At 3:39 or so, WillRock uses Solo! It&#8217;s super effective! Yes, I&#8217;m gonna continue these jokes. With this album, it&#8217;s kinda mandatory, ya know? Everything builds up after this solo until 4:38, when a hint of the end reveals itself. 4:50 slows everything down to it&#8217;s base level. Ambience to finish. Great way to end the first disc.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DISC 2</strong></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. WillRock &#8211; Champion&#8217;s Horizon (Route #26) 4:47</span><br /> Starts out rocking right out the gate. Classic WillRock sound permeates this track, as with most of his other tracks. 0:29 brings in calm source usage. 0:39 is the return of the synth sound. 0:54 has the classic screaming guitar sound that is so beautiful. 1:17 brings in a solo. 1:53 or so brings more source usage. 2:12 has some piano; a rare calm spot for a WillRock track. But 2:25 proves it was just the calm before the storm, as everything intensifies tenfold from here on out. This is truly one heck of a track, and truly fantastic. 3:19 brings in some triumphant sounding guitar. 3:50 or so has a victorious solo. More calmness at 4:05 or so. 4:22 says PIKA!! And repeats a few more times until the end. Cute and unexpected.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Insert Rupee &#8211; Precious Metals (Goldenrod City) 2:25</span><br /> Ben Briggs and halc team up once more for this song. Very evident source usage. Very happy as well; the musical glee is reminiscent of Why So Serious? More source usage at 0:58 or so, with a bit of a personalized touch. 1:12 has a solo using some classic sounds and PokÃ©mon cries. 1:42 has another solo. It all breaks down to simplicity at 2:07, and continues until the end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. WillRock &#8211; Slowpoke Shuffle (Azalea Town) 3:49</span><br /> Ttthhhiiisss tttrrraaaccckkk iiiissss sssslllloooowwww&#8230;. A very mellow track; very well done Will! I&#8217;m half-tempted to review this song in the conclusion as a joke, but I won&#8217;t. Source is very evient throughout this track. 2:00 brings in a slow solo&#8230; a slowlo if you will. Source usage returns to dominance at 3:00 or so. Calmness continues to the end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Mattias HÃ¤ggstrÃ¶m Gerdt, GSlicer &#8211; Casino Lounge (Goldenrod Game Corner) 4:43</span><br /> Anso&#8217;s electronic expertise and GSlicer&#8217;s skills combine for one trance-tacular track. Rhythm appears at 0:30 or so. Source usage at 1:45 or so. This is a very rhythm-driven song; it works though. A bit of a solo begins at about 2:10. It&#8217;s like Rain Dance and then a water move; one part emphasizes the other. Nice work. Source returns at 3:30 or so. Calmness begins at 3:58 or so, and then builds up to the finale. Solo beat at 4:18, and then fadeout until the end.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Chrono, Dragon Avenger &#8211; Divine Olivine (Violet City) 4:15</span><br /> What a happy beat! If Deia&#8217;s involved, I&#8217;m expecting vocals to go with a beat like this. Chimes play throughout. Source at 0:32. 0:47 brings in Deia going &#8220;na-na-na&#8221; more than <a title="It's the video. Click at your own discretion" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egG7fiE89IU">that recent My Chemical Romance song</a>. This is cooler too. More source at 1:21. Short breakdown at 1:35 or so. 1:56 brings Deia back, with backup vocals by DragonAvenger. Pretty well done. 2:38 brings in some beautiful piano, that brings in even more of the source. 3:14 returns the source that had been used up until this point. Basic beat from 3:55 or so until the end, with occasional chimes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. DragonAvenger &#8211; Jiggly Choir (Jigglypuff&#8217;s Song) 0:42</span><br /> Okay, creeped out a bit. Damn Jigglypuffs&#8230; Anyone else getting sleepy? All this track contains is Jigglypuff singing. Pretty funny for an interlude. Then again, Deia did those on the <a title="Also a great album" href="http://ff4.ocremix.org/">FF4 album </a>too&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. ProtoDome &#8211; Home Is Where the Luvdisc Is&#8230; [Hearthome City (Day)] 1:45</span><br /> 0:12 brings in some jazzy source. Piano is used equally as the brass instruments. A bit of a solo begins at about 1:05. This continues until the end; beautifully done, Proto. Beautiful!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. halc &#8211; My Friend Mudkip (Dewford Town ~ Surfing) 3:13</span><br /> And now for the only Generation 3 remix on the album. Begins with some nice chippiness, and a great take on the source too. 0:30 brings in some background music. Also, for the record, I do like Mudkip. This is a very happy track, and chippier than a truckload of Lay&#8217;s put through a wood chipper. 1:30 brings in the Surfing source. This is even better than Shades of Red, believe it or not. A bit of a calm spot starts at 2:15 or so. A bit like Pacifidlog Town itself. Except this doesn&#8217;t float atop a colony of Corsola. Calmness and bass to end from 2:50 or so.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. The Orichalcon &#8211; Argent Vexemon (Ice Path) 3:33</span><br /> This is a very frigid song; by that, I mean the sounds are very icy. Bells and the like are used. 0:37 starts some electronic sounds. This a very intense song; 0:57 brings in a heavy beat. More source usage at 1:23 or so. There&#8217;s a large focus on the main rhythm here. A bit of a solo begins at 2:27 or so. A buildup to the end begins after this solo; the end really begins at 3:12, when it all starts to fade to silence until the end.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. ProtoDome &#8211; May I Have This Swords Dance? [Canalave City (Day)] 2:51</span><br /> A very calm song&#8230; it starts to build right from the start until 0:23 when the source comes in. Some jazziness comes in at 0:37, taking on the source. This is a very well-balanced mix of chiptune and jazz. Chipjazz, if you will, is pretty much Proto&#8217;s specialty, it seems. Solo at 1:27 or so, and it&#8217;s beautiful. There&#8217;s some pitch bending at 1:46 or so; continues until 2:06 when a breakdown occurs. Sax-sound comes in at 2:11 and continues until the end. Piano finishes the track. Nice work by Blake the British guy who&#8217;s a bit strange&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">11. Fishy, Andy Jayne &#8211; Super Effective [Battle! Trainer (Johto)] 5:15</span><br /> Ah, Fishy and Andy. A collab unseen since Summoning of Spirits. 0:20 brings in some epic guitar source usage. This song is even longer than Battle for the Badge; with this much rock I can&#8217;t wait to see how much it progresses. More source usage at 1:08. Some solo at 1:27 or so. Once again, it&#8217;s hard to review because all I want to do is listen. Mor source usage at 1:57 here. This song is certainly super effective against my musical tastes; I&#8217;m loving the dual guitars. More solo at 2:41, and this one sounds quite heavy. Source returns at 3:04 or so. Another solo at 3:17 that quickly returns to source usage. 3:47 brings in some more rocking on the source that is a mix between cover and solo as with so many other parts of this song. This is such a fast-paced song. Slowdown at 4:27 that brings in some piano. Slowness continues until 5:02 when it all starts to fade away.</p> 
    
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12. WillRock, ProtoDome, halc &#8211; Bullet for My Piloswine [Route #225 (Day) ~ Ending] 4:00</span><br /> Vocals at the start; Pretty rocking start. Chippiness comes in at 0:25. Also, this song is guilty of one of the most simultaneously horrid and awesome puns for a title ever. Rocking at 0:37 courtesy of Mr. Harby. More chiptunes at 0:53 or so. Heavy guitar at 1:25 or so. Solo at about 1:40. This is certainly an epic track. Piano comes in at 2:08, no doubt courtesy of Proto. Chiptunes at 2:23. More guitar at 2:33. Dual guitar sound at 2:48 or so. More awesome guitar at 3:20. Fade beginning at 3:49 or so until end.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">13. pu_freak &#8211; Journey&#8217;s End (Ending) 3:09</span><br /> And we come to the final track, with a very fitting title. What an aural journey it has been, too. Very awesome piano, here. Then again, what OCR album these days doesn&#8217;t have at least one epic piano track? Very slow track, but the source is highly evident. I don&#8217;t anticipate a huge buildup here, as it&#8217;s the last track, and relatively short too. But it does start to build starting at about 1:40. The finale is surely imminent. This such a beautiful track&#8230; it all starts to decline to silence at 2:30, with very calm piano dispersed throughout this final period. Ends with a classic sound effect.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span><br /> Well, this album has been in the works for 4 years now, right around the time when Diamond and Pearl came out, heralding the beginning of Generation 4 and showing a grand total of 493 unique PokÃ©mon. And now, in less than a week Black and White come out, starting off Generation 5 and bringing the total up to 649. This album has been a long time coming, and that&#8217;s a very good thing. A nice balance between jazz, chiptunes, and epic guitar-driven rock, among other things, it comes together nicely. It&#8217;s definitely worth a download, and every track has earned its place on my hard drive. A much anticipated album, and the expectations were never too high. The end result met them and exceeded them without a doubt. Great work from everyone involved, and I can&#8217;t wait to hear and review the next album, whatever it may be. The only sure thing is that it will be OCRA-0024. Until next time, game on!
