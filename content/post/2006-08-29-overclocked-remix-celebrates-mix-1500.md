Today OCReMix celebrates <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01500/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s 1500th remix</a> (a djp tune at that), ChipAmp, a new torrent, and various other changes.

_&#8220;We&#8217;re back. After a drought of mixes, a server migration, and months
  
of headaches and coordination, OCR01500 is upon us, and along with it
  
quite a few changes, some big, some small, to OverClocked ReMix in
  
general. Where to begin? About four months ago I was having a rough
  
time with &#8220;big life questions&#8221; and what not, and felt like I had
  
reached a point where I needed to decide where to focus my energy &#8211;
  
where to invest myself, if you will. I&#8217;ve always felt like I could
  
accomplish a lot if I put my mind to it, but I&#8217;ve never been 100% sure _what_
  
&#8220;it&#8221; should be, in other words. I looked at what I&#8217;d done and what I
  
felt I could do, and essentially decided that OverClocked ReMix was
  
still something I could pour my heart and soul into and feel good about._

_That decision&#8217;s been vindicated by several events since then: we had a wonderful time at [Video Games Live](http://www.videogameslive.com/) in Philly, our [Otakon](http://www.otakon.com/)
  
panel went swimmingly, and we&#8217;ve had some generous donations that have
  
allowed us to migrate to our own dedicated servers for the first time
  
in the site&#8217;s seven-year history. I&#8217;m personally proud of what I&#8217;ve
  
been able to do for the site recently, and I&#8217;m just as proud of
  
everything our listeners and staff have done as well. Being on our own
  
server should give us a good deal more technical flexibility to
  
experiment with dynamic functionality, and we still plan to migrate our
  
forums to vbulletin soon, as well. We&#8217;re also looking into an
  
arrangement with [eStarland.com](http://www.estarland.com/showban.asp?action=redir&campaign=139) to get reliable international shipping of OC ReMix T-shirts, hoodies, and bumper stickers running.&#8221;_
