In addition to updating PHPNuke and fixing/adding/cleaning up a few
  
modules, as Fusion mentioned, I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to purchasing <a target="_self" href="http://www.ThaSauce.net">ThaSauce.net</a>.
  
Currently I just own the domain, which redirects to here, and anyone
  
who remembers the ThaSauce.Fusion2004p.com host will remember that if
  
you&#8217;re using IE and logging in via the redirect, you&#8217;ll get logged out.

Once the majority of the kinks are worked out of the site and I can
  
afford it, I can just update the domain for hosting, bumping up the
  
price from $10 a year to $10 a month (more or less), but until then
  
this works. =P
