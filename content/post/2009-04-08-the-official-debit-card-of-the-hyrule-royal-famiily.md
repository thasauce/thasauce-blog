<div class="quoted-text">
  I decided to try my hand at doing one of those customized debit cards<br /> from my credit union. I uploaded one of my wallpapers and cropped it<br /> and submitted it. I really didn&#8217;t hold any hope that they&#8217;d print it,<br /> because they&#8217;re pretty strict about what you can and cannot have on<br /> your card. Really, this should not have passed, but, for some<br /> reason&#8230;it <em>did</em>.

Either the person approving card designs wasn&#8217;t paying attention and
  
didn&#8217;t realize what it was, or they knew what it was and agreed with
  
the awesomeness!
