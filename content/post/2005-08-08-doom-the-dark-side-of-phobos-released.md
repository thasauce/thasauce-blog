There are both Mp3 downloads and a (quite large) Bittorrent file with
  
both Flac and Mp3 available on the site. I recommend that you use the
  
Bittorrent, if just to ease the assault on the mirrors. If you can,
  
please seed once you are done downloading! More information is
  
available on the site. Please direct your comments, complaints,
  
compliments and other feedback to [this thread](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1776067) and I hope you enjoy **The Dark Side of Phobos!**
