For you Orlando residents out there, [we just got word](https://www.facebook.com/randomencounterband/posts/303970566328723) that [Random Encounter](http://randomencounterband.com/) is playing a free show at the Geek Easy **tomorrow, February 24th**:

> Hey everybody! Did you know we&#8217;re playing a FREE SHOW atÂ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegeekeasy" target="_blank">The Geek Easy</a>Â in Orlando next Friday the 24th? Because we are! And guess what! We&#8217;re playing 2 never before heard songs at this show as well as all of our regular goodies. But make sure to come, because this will be the last time we will play (most) of this set. We&#8217;re writing and arranging new music and will not be playing (most) of this stuff for some time! AGAIN, it&#8217;s FREE!Â <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StarLakeBand" target="_blank">Star Lake</a>Â will be joining us and it will be a super amazing time!

With their amazing stage presence and crazy show antics, we&#8217;d definitely say that Random Encounter is one of the best live performances we&#8217;ve seen in the VGM community to date. This free show is restricted to those 16 and up, so no tweens allowed. And for those who are 21+, you can BYOB (holla!). Donations are also being accepted, so please be generous! Be sure to [RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/299784783412458/?ref=nf) on Facebook, as well as enjoy rad tunes from one of the best VGM cover bands out there.
