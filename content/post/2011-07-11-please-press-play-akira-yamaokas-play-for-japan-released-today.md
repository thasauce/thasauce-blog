In a wonderfully heartfelt response to the devastating tragedy that tore through Japan on March 11<sup>th</sup>, Akira Yamaoka has reached out and organized a benefit album with one simple, inspiring message in mind: â€œJapan is not alone.â€ Aptly entitled _[Play For Japan](http://playforjapan.org/),_ Yamaoka hopes to reach out to those affected by both the tsunamis and Tohoku earthquake as well as raise awareness of Japanâ€™s invaluable contributions through technology, entertainment, and culture.

Yamaoka, known for his continued involvement within the _Silent Hill_ series as both producer and sound director, has secured the participation of several prominent composers within the VGM scene. [Koji Kondo](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/Koji_Kondo/) (_[Mario](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/Mario/)/[Zelda](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/zelda/)_ series), [Yasunori Mitsuda](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/Mitsuda/) ([_Chrono Trigger_ series](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/Chrono_Series/)), Woody Jackson (_L.A. Noire_), [Nobuo Uematsu](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/Uematsu/) ([_Final Fantasy_ series](http://remix.thasauce.net/tags/view/Final_Fantasy/)), Inon Zur (_Fallout_ series), Laura Shigihara (_Plants vs. Zombies_, see recent ThaSauce articles [here](http://thasauce.net/2011/07/10/laura-shigihara-posts-new-original-for-upcoming-indie-game/) and [here](http://thasauce.net/2011/07/01/plants-vs-zombies-medley-recreated-with-four-gu-zheng-rad-video/)), Hip Tanaka (_[Earthbound](http://remix.thasauce.net/game/69/)),_ and Jason Graves (_Dead Space_ series) are just a few of the superb talents that have confirmed involvement with the _Play For Japan_ project.

Yamaoka has also expressed his own concern of bringing together game and music enthusiasts alike through _Play For Japan:_ â€œIn the videogame industry, composers like myself are responsible for engaging the player through music. Music, too, creates bonds, inspiring listeners to share their passion with others. In this spirit, many gifted composers, musicians and artists â€” from East and West â€” have come together to record a benefit album. For creators whose role is to inspire, itâ€™s only fitting we come together, across borderlines, for those in need.â€

[Out now on the iTunes Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/play-for-you/id448514968?i=448515021&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, _Play For Japan_ will become available worldwide on July 15<sup>th</sup> through iTunes and Amazon. 100% of the proceeds will go towards the relief efforts in Japan. If not for _Play For Music_â€™s inspirational message alone, we hope you take your time out to definitely press play for Japan.
