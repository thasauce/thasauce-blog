  One of the only double reviews in existence, to my knowledge. Two albums, two artists, one article. It's the perfect set-up! Be sure to read it and decide if you want these albums.

  You should. They are free, and a lot of love went into making them. Read on!

Well this is a new thing. Behold, the double review! Glorious, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve been meaning to review JH Sound&#8217;s Genuine LP for a while now, and once halc released his Pixel Perfect EP I knew I&#8217;d be reviewing that too. What better time than now than to do so, and why not review both in the same article? I regularly review double-disc albums anyways, so this is basically the same. Except that both discs are standalone albums and only related tangentially through the artist&#8217;s connections in the remixing community, and me. So here goes nothing!

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">JH SOUNDS &#8211; GENUINE</span>**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. GenuineÂ Â Â Â  3:00<br /> </span> A pretty mellow track, with the title repeated for a while until about 0:47. At 1:03 it comes back, all chopped up. At this point, it becomes apparent that the word itself is used as an instrument unto itself. Drumwork is nice. At 2:38 the word fades out and JH&#8217;s trademark chime comes in to end.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. PianaÂ Â Â Â  3:08<br /> </span> Fittingly enough, it begins with piano. And synth. A good combo, too! This track has a good melody to it. It switches up at about 1:04 and returns at 1:18 or so. 1:28 brings a breakdown that sounds sweet, and totally gives the song a new feel. Rhythm returns at about 2:20. Fades to end at 3:05
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. GlobalizationÂ Â Â Â  2:56<br /> </span> Sounds like a broken sound chip on an SNES at first; at 0:18 the beginnings of a pattern form and at 0:26 they come into full effect. A fun melody comes in at about 0:40. 1:25 brings a new instrument in, and like the other songs here, it adds to the ambience of the track. It ends to whistling at 2:30. The whistling itself ends at 2:50.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. CreepersÂ Â Â Â  3:03<br /> </span> Funky track; sounds like it would work with the Munsters or something similar too, which rocks. The main melody ends for a brief time at 1:04 when a voice clip comes in. The music returns at 1:27 or so. The melody tunes down at 2:13, and returns at 2:22.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. AOTDÂ Â Â Â  2:52<br /> </span> Interesting vocal clip from injury&#8230; the drums are solid again. The music jumps around a tiny bit, but it&#8217;s very enjoyable. As the song goes on, injury&#8217;s voice clip works as another instrument, like Noah Ludington&#8217;s voice clip from track one. It dies at 2:48 in humorous fashion.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Flatline feat. bill cakesÂ Â Â Â  3:02<br /> </span> Starts out with a flatline, naturally. Guitar here courtesy of bill cakes, and it&#8217;s done beautifully. At 0:49 the main track comes in, and it&#8217;s awesome. I really like what the two did here; it&#8217;s a beautiful collab. Then again, JH is great at collabs soo&#8230; yeah. Anyways, bill breaks down the guitar at about 2:00 in grand fashion. The song winds down at 2:52.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. AmbushÂ Â Â Â  2:59<br /> </span> This sounds like a menacing track&#8230; I like it! Sounds like something big&#8217;s about to go down! Drums come in at 0:36 and add to the intensity. Mix-up at 1:26 doesn&#8217;t change the feel, and the drums returning keep it as tense as before. I want this song to play before I go to do anything, just to make it that much more dramatic. The sirens in the background starting at about 2:00 or so help too. It winds down starting at 2:30. It ends with a voice clip.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. InfamyÂ Â Â Â  3:05<br /> </span> This song starts with FDR&#8217;s famous address to Congress after Pearl Harbor happened. Fitting, since the song&#8217;s name is infamy and FDR says it in said speech. I&#8217;m sure when FDR was alive, he never dreamed his voice would be used in a song like this. It&#8217;s actually a bit humorous. I like this track; it&#8217;s nice, and at 1:45 more of the speech is used a bit. Voice clip is chopped up starting at 2:25 or so. Breakdowns on this CD are quite regular and well&#8230; genuine. Voice clip chop to end.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. CheekyÂ Â Â Â  2:58<br /> </span> White Stripes sample start the song out, and it&#8217;s nice. The drums and melody in the background are calming and fit the song. Trippy voice sample echo effect at 1:45 or so. This continues until 2:12 or so. Echo is used again every time the voice clip is used thereafter. A nice peaceful track.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. FishyÂ Â Â Â  3:55<br /> </span> This track starts out quiet and builds up in grand fashion. Fittingly enough, this track contains a sample from the song &#8220;Echoes&#8221; by Fishy, alias Cain McCormack. The melody is beautiful and the mood is big. The sample comes in at 1:50 or so. It&#8217;s a bit strange, but it works. There&#8217;s a nice rhythm from about 2:30 until the end that works fantastically. Song starts to end at 3:43 and ends at 3:52.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">11. MotorwayÂ Â Â Â  3:13<br /> </span> I just want to drive slowly listening to this song, even though I don&#8217;t know how to drive. It&#8217;s a fun track, with a nice moving rhythm. It&#8217;s calm and peaceful too. The melody goes basic at 2:50 and this plays until the end.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">12. PrayerÂ Â Â Â  4:04</span>
  
For the final main track of the album, JH decided to go religious a bit. A voice clip of a prayer begins the track, albeit a bit delayed. The melody plays throughout this voice clip, which plays throughout the entire track. Bass comes in at 1:12. Everything stops at 1:58 and resumes at 2:00. This entire speech is quite hilarious in it&#8217;s nonsensicality. There is a very defined rhythm, and the speech ends at 3:30. The melody continues until the end of the track.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">13. Piana (RoboRob SpaceShip ReMix)Â Â Â Â  3:12<br /> </span> Ah yes, a remix&#8230; Very groovy and electronica-y. Some orchestral-like instrument comes in at 0:30. 1:01 brings about more of the main melody. 1:30 brings a voice clip, and 1:38 showcases a pretty slick effect. Sounds like the instruments in the source were sampled here for a more electronic sound. It&#8217;s a great mix, and fun to listen to. Everything continues as normal until 3:07 when it all suddenly stops.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">HALC &#8211; PIXEL PERFECT</span>**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. First HeadacheÂ Â Â Â  2:16<br /> </span> This sounds like the Game Boy Zelda fairy music at first. It&#8217;s very peaceful and relaxed. More chippiness comes in at 0:30, showing the main melody. It is also reminiscent of old Kirby music. It slows down at about 1:10. This is a very catchy track, and doesn&#8217;t incite a headache at all. It calms down at 1:58 or so.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Floating AwayÂ Â Â Â  2:56<br /> </span> Great choppy chips of Cthulhu! This song is more ethereal than a cloud! Was that a Mega Man sound effect I heard? 0:43 brings in some melody aside from the rhythm. 1:24 brings a breakdown, and the music slowly lowers it&#8217;s volume. At 1:44 it comes back. Looks like halc learned much from chthonic&#8230; err&#8230; Ben Briggs, in their time working together! Everything goes quiet at about 2:20 until the end, as it all slowly fades away.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. 17-bitÂ Â Â Â  2:17<br /> </span> The melody comes in almost immediately. There is a very&#8230; not quite victorious or triumphant, but close&#8230; there is that sort of feel to this track. Like you&#8217;ve just done something monumental, but it&#8217;s not really a big deal&#8230; It quiets down at about 1:20 and returns at 1:38. Awesome chippiness at 1:54 or so. At 2:08 it begins it&#8217;s final descent.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. White-OutÂ Â Â Â  2:15</span>
  
Funky, groovy, nice bass. 0:10 brings in some melodious awesomeness. 0:28 shows off some echo-like chimes. This song has created it&#8217;s own ambience, and feels like an old cavernous dungeon theme from a game of yesteryear. 1:08 brings in another melody, albeit faint, and 1:28 mixes it up a bit. It returns at 1:45 with new beats. Bass to end.
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Bad DecisionsÂ Â Â Â  3:20<br /> </span> I don&#8217;t think this song was a bad decision at all! Sure, it starts out slow, but it is building up to something epic. It keeps going, and by 0:30 there is some rhythm. 0:52 adds more rhythm, and 1:09 kicks off the melody. 1:28 adds some drum effects, with some bass effects. Main melody returns at 2:00, with some mixage of it incorporated. Now this sounds like some sort of infiltration theme for an old game. It fades out starting at 3:00 until the end. And a great end it is!

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCLUSION</span>**
  
First off, JH&#8217;s album. It&#8217;s a great freshman effort, and it&#8217;s beautful. I would expect to see this on store shelves or something. It&#8217;s a highly enjoyable collection of average-sized tracks, perfect for someone on the go!
  
halc&#8217;s album, Pixel Perfect, shows off his champion chiptune skills masterfully, and is a great example of how old sounds can sound fresh and exciting. Each track is bite-sized, and full of nostalgic effects. Highly recommended, and highly advised for download. I hope he releases an LP of this soon; I must have more!
  
All in all, both albums are fantastic efforts by both artists, and are but the beginning of what they have in store, I&#8217;m sure. You can find more from JH at his website, [jhsounds.com](http://www.jhsounds.com "It's his shiny new website!!"), and more from halc at his website, [halc9bit.com](http://blog.halc9bit.com "don't waste your halcyon days on this site"). In our next thrilling installment, we&#8217;ll have a new album by that guy who has the perfect gigoquotes. If you know what that means, then I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;re reading this. Until next time, game on!!
