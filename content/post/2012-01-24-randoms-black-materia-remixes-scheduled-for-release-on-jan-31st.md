Especially since we&#8217;ve called _Black Materia_Â one of the bestÂ Final Fantasy VII tributes out there, there should beÂ [no wonder](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/23/quick-look-mega-rans-pump-it-up-feat-adam-warrock/) that we&#8217;re [huge fans](http://thasauce.net/2011/06/26/mega-ran-releases-new-video-one-winged-angel/) of Phoenix-based rapper [Random](http://megaran.com/). Yes, we&#8217;ve probably spoken about him multiple times to the point of rambling like a prepubescent girl would her favorite movie star, but can you blame us? Random&#8217;s wonderful work on _[Black Materia](http://megaranmusic.com/album/black-materia-final-fantasy-vii)_Â shows that he can still appeal to a universal audience outside of the video gameÂ community, which may be seen as a great feat when discussing the inclusivity of the general public in such a tight-knit community.

Speaking of _Black Materia,_ you&#8217;re in for a delicious treat. AÂ full year after the original album&#8217;s release,Â Random&#8217;sÂ _Black Materia: RemixesÂ _featuringÂ additional guests, rearranged songs, and exclusive remastered content is scheduled to be made availableÂ **next Tuesday, January 31st**. All production has been once again handled by [Lost Perception](http://lostperception.com/), in addition toÂ [DJ DN3](https://www.facebook.com/pages/DJ-DN%C2%B3/150644625048227?sk=wall), and mixing and mastering by [K-Murdock](https://www.facebook.com/NeosonicProd). There are at least three all-new tracks, with one featuring [Adam Warrock](http://www.adamwarrock.com/).Â While you preview one of Random&#8217;s newest songs from the upcomingÂ _Remixes_ album below, we suggest that you pre-orderÂ _Black Materia: The Remixes_Â [on Bandcamp](http://megaranmusic.com/album/black-materia-the-remixes), obtainableÂ for a mere five dollars.
