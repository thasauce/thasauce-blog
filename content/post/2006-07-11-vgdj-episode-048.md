<span>Whaaaaaat?</span> How did we manage
  
to let our &#8220;mini episode&#8221; exceed the 35-minute mark?! Oh right. It&#8217;s
  
because there were a whopping four ReMix Reviews this week, plus the
  
VGDJ Awkward Trivia Contest Giveaway, plus cohosting co-embarrassment,
  
plus our hordes of creepy callers. (Seriously, where do you guys come
  
up with these things?) Anywho, we hope you enjoy this somewhat abridged
  
edition of vee gee dee jay. Had a lot going on this past week, but have
  
no fear: we&#8217;ll be back in full feature action next episode&#8230; with the
  
debut of zircon&#8217;s swanky new remixing tutorial! Until then, enjoy.

### VGDJ: Shownotes #048 {.post-title}

<span>[01:05] </span>Okay, wtf&#8230;? <span>Mini episode MY ARSE</span>!
  
We may have cut out all the weekly reports and Russian ReMix Roulette,
  
but this show still ended up coming to almost 40 minutes! In any case,
  
your dearest cohosts have lives outside of VGDJ (believe it or not),
  
and didn&#8217;t have the time to edit a full show this week. Solly&#8230;  
<span>[04:07]</span> [VOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTE!](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140)  
<span>[05:00] </span>But
  
that&#8217;s okay, because we have some special things in the works for our
  
next two shows! Episode 049 will feature the very first installation of
  
zircon&#8217;s brand new remixing tutorial, appropriately titled &#8220;<span>The Flow Basket</span>.&#8221; Aaaaaaand, as if that isn&#8217;t enough, OUR FIFTIETH EPISODE IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. Many surprises in store.  
<span>[06:32] </span>Announcing the second winner of our <span>Awkward Trivia Contest Giveaway</span>:
  
lancer130! Congrats: your answer was thorough&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..ly amusing!
  
Hyuck hyuck. Be on the lookout for SuperGreenX&#8217;s remix albums &#8220;Chroma&#8221;
  
and &#8220;Better Than Sliced Beats,&#8221; for they shall be arriving soon. And
  
now, for your last chance to win these phat beats&#8230;

<span>This week&#8217;s question</span>:
  
We&#8217;ve had three *stingers thus far that have been connected in their
  
theme and concept. Tell us what they are, and what episodes they were
  
on. (And no, they aren&#8217;t about Rama, because we totally make fun of him
  
all the time. ^_~) Additionally, we would like to know your most
  
embarrassing nickname, explained for all the world to hear! As always,
  
be sure to email your response to vgdjpodcast@gmail.com by noon this
  
Thursday!

* (&#8220;Stinger&#8221; is the term we use to describe the random
  
bit we tack on at the very end of each show, after the voicemail
  
section.)  
<span>[09:42] </span>PIXIE PUBLICLY HUMILIATES ZIRCON by revealing <span>his</span>
  
embarrassing nickname. But being a nice little fairy, she evens out the
  
count with her own. What do you think? &#8220;Bear and Jillybean discuss the
  
world of OverClocked ReMix, a community dedicated to the appreciation
  
and reinterpretation of video game music&#8221;&#8230;? Hmmm, maybe next Easter.  
<span>[11:43]</span> <span>ReMix Review</span>: From [Awesome](http://www.ocremix.org/game/awesome/): &#8216;[Game Over (Cheeze Mix)](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01490/)&#8216; by [Erik S](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/eriks/) &#8230; OMG learn how to spell &#8220;cheese,&#8221; kay? XD And cheesy it is&#8230; kind of like an 80&#8217;s vampire movie! Solid work from Erik S.  
<span>[14:37] </span><span>ReMix Review</span>: From [7th Guest](http://www.ocremix.org/game/7thguest/): &#8216;[Microscopism](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01491/)&#8216; by [Mazedude](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/mazedude/)
  
&#8230; Pixie must remember to wipe her drool listening to this sexy
  
Mazedude remix. (Question is, does the adjective &#8220;sexy&#8221; modify the noun
  
&#8220;Mazedude&#8221; or &#8220;remix&#8221; in this context? Guess you&#8217;ll never know!) Zircon
  
is very happy to read an original composer name that he can pronounce,
  
and you&#8217;re sure to dig this quirky industrial track!  
<span>[17:16] </span><span>ReMix Review</span>: From [Final Fantasy 7](http://www.ocremix.org/game/ff7/): &#8216;[The Twelf Commandment](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01492/)&#8216; by [Midee](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/midee/) and [Prozax](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/prozax/)
  
&#8230; A dynamic duo indeed! Midee and Prozax put their heads together yet
  
again for a smashing rock/orchestral remix. Definitely check out the
  
whole song from das linken above, because it was difficult to choose
  
just one section to feature on the show. This piece is ever-changing!  
<span>[20:14] </span><span>ReMix Review</span>: From [Zombies Ate My Neighbors](http://www.ocremix.org/game/zombiesatemyneighbors/): &#8216;[The Curse](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01493/)&#8216; by [Christian Pacaud](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/christianpacaud/)
  
&#8230; Captain Christian Pacaud of the U.S.S. Enterprise! XD This mix is a
  
great example of &#8220;reinterpretation.&#8221; The source tunes weren&#8217;t all that
  
great, to be quite honest, so we were impressed with what C-Pac was
  
able to create under the circumstances. Exxxxcccellent. (Pixie edit: Oh
  
yeah, and sorry about my laughing at your voice crack, Zirkie dear&#8230;
  
NOT~~@~!)  
<span>[22:56] </span>Still laughing!  
<span>[23:29] </span>GET
  
AWAY FROM US YOU SCARY CALLERS! Here is a little collection of
  
disturbing voicemails we received this past week. Thanks Toot, Abadoss,
