<div>
  As I&#8217;ve completed modules in part of Anime Remix 3.0, I&#8217;ve selected a group of testers to clean up the site.  I&#8217;ve had a lot of input from djpretzel, mDuo, and others on the site design and concepts.  I&#8217;ve developed my own backend that will allow for very easy maintenance of the site, and I still have maintained the idea of customization via skins.

I&#8217;m currently looking for a Test Manager to ensure the testers are testing according to the rules as well as making sure that each Error/Bug is properly handled.  Let me know if you&#8217;re interested via <a href="mailto:xal3ph@yahoo.com" target="_self">email</a>.

We&#8217;re currently restructuring our administration and the way a few things work.  It&#8217;ll fix some issues and questions that were previously raised.
