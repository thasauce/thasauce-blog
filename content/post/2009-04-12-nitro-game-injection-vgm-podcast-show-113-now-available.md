  Some of you might remember my live webcast Nitro Game Injection, which<br /> has been going off and on (mostly off) for over the past five years.<br /> The show has been revived and revamped a few times now, but this newest<br /> incarnation will be the best yet, guaranteed!
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  For those who don&#8217;t know:</p> 
  
  <p>
    Nitro Game Injection (NGI) is a video game music podcast that focuses<br /> on original soundtracks, remixes, cover tunes, and doujin bands.<br /> It was started in early 2003 as a live webcast and has gone on for over<br /> 100 shows. As of episode 113, the format has shifted to a bi-weekly<br /> podcast format.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The show is hosted by Kyle &ldquo;KyleJCrb&rdquo; Crouse and, as of episode #113,<br /> the long-awaited return of VG Frequency host and OCR judge Larry<br /> &ldquo;Liontamer&rdquo; Oji.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The show features video game discussion, news on recent releases and happenings within the community, interviews with artists,<br /> requests, and more!

    We just released our first show in the podcast format, with Larry as<br /> co-host. It&#8217;s a 3-hour show, which is rare for a podcast, but there is<br /> a lot of great music involved as well as banter with myself and Larry. <a target="_blank" href="http://kngi.org/2009/04/12/nitro-game-injection-113-revenge-of-the-podcast/#more-73">check it out!</a>

    EDIT: For those curious, the show is not on iTunes yet, but will be after Apple reviews it.
