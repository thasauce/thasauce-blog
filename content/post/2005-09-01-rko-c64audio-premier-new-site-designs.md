Two foundations of the Commodore arrangement scene received facelifts late last night as <a target="_self" href="http://remix.kwed.org/">Remix.Kwed.Org</a> creator Jan Lund &#8220;Kwed&#8221; Thomas and <a target="_self" href="http://www.c64audio.com/">C64Audio.com</a>
  
creator Chris Abbott each revealed their respective sites&#8217; new looks.

Following up <a target="_self" href="http://www.amigaremix.com/">AMIGAremix</a>&#8216;s redesign earlier this year, Kwed collaborated
  
with John Mirland to streamline R:K:O, featuring the addition of
  
randomized SID downloads to encourage the remixing of broader material,
  
as well as community links, donor thanks, and better integration of the <a target="_self" href="http://www.slayradio.org/podcast/">C64 Take-away</a> podcast.

C64Audio, noted vendor of professionally released Commodore community
  
music from both C64 arrangers & composers, debuted its first major
  
redesign in roughly 5 years, with emphasis placed on frontpage listings
  
of its CD catalog. Soon-to-be-available releases there include Makke&#8217;s new album <a target="_self" href="http://www.c64audio.com/productInfo.php?cat=BINBABE">&#8220;It&#8217;s Binary Baby,&#8221;</a> as well as the <a target="_self" href="http://www.c64audio.com/productInfo.php?cat=C64DVD1"><span class="indentHeading"><br /> Back in Time Live DVD/CD Set</span></a>.

Discussion of the revamped sites is ongoing in <a target="_self" href="http://www.remix64.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=2856">the thread</a> @ <a target="_self" href="http://www.remix64.com/board/">the Remix64 message boards</a>.
