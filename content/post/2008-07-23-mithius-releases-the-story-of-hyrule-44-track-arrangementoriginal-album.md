<img border="0" align="right" src="images/newsMisc/storyhyrule-release.png" />A few days ago, on a couple of forums, community member mithius released &#8220;The Story of Hyrule.&#8221; An epic 44 track album, comprised of both arrangements from Zelda 1 through a Link to the Past, as well as a number of original tracks. The post was long and kind of disjointed, the website was a bit &#8220;1996&#8221;, but the music was absolutely AMAZING. That&#8217;s when I decided <a target="_self" href="http://remix.thasauce.net/thestoryofhyrule/">to start work on a proper website and hosting </a>to really showcase mithius&#8217;s hard work.
  
I want to point out that, even though it&#8217;s hosted under the ReMix:ThaSauce subdomain, this album is NOT affiliated with R:TS or ThaSauce at all. I simply wanted to make sure this album got proper presentation. All the music and story on the site is by mithius and mithius alone. All I did was give him a website and some hosting. (I would&#8217;ve like to give him a subdomain, but that&#8217;s just not an option at this point.)

Anyway, give it a listen an enjoy an epic musical journey through the lands of Hyrule!
