From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgdj.net">vgdj.net</a>:

&#8220;This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):

Care for a spot of tea? No? Then perhaps OCR&#8217;s 1500th remix will
  
strike your fancy. That&#8217;s right: #1500 has finally been released, which
  
means that not only is VGDJ back in action, but the community has
  
picked up steam as well.
   
We&#8217;ve got the inside scoop on this latest wave
  
of site changes, along with a full compliment of reports, reviews,
  
voicemails, and all that good stuff. Listen as your beloved hosts brave
  
Baltimore&#8217;s fiercest tropical storm, turning rain into fair English
  
skies. Plus a stinger we think will truly move you&#8230; to tears! >:) What a lovely day for a stroll in Episode 055, wouldn&#8217;t you agree, my deah?&#8221;

Also, it&#8217;s a new month, so make sure to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140">vote</a>!
