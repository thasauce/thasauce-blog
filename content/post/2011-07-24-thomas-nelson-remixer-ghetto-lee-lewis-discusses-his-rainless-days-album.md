Thomas Nelson, better known in the arrangement community as [Ghetto Lee Lewis](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/ghetto-lee-lewis/) (GLL), took some time to answer a few of my questions regarding his recent original album [_Rainless Days_](http://tnelson.bandcamp.com/album/rainless-days). It is the first album he has ever released, featuring somber and reflective solo piano. Nelson is no stranger to the remixing community; several of his tracks are posted on [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) covering games from _Dragon Warrior_ to _Tales of Phantasia_ in the style of trance. With _Rainless Days_, he uses his raw skill on the keys for an assortment of self-composed material.

As he mentioned in the description of his album page, the release â€œmarks a transition in my life, going from a failed marriage and life of depression to being able to move on with my life and find happiness once again.â€ He elaborated further on this period of change:Â  â€œMy wife filed for divorce back in March I think, and so I had to move out. We were married for just over two years. I&#8217;ve been living in an apartment with a roommate since then.â€ Nelson remarked on the albumâ€™s title, and how lack of rain â€œis a metaphor for the emptiness and loneliness I&#8217;ve felt for much of my life.â€ In his Nevada residence, the desert climate is such that rainfall is seen as a special and uplifting event.

Nelson started work on the album on June 6, 2011 and developed it over the course of the month. â€œI recorded &#8220;Song for Miku&#8221; about a week before I started on the other tracks.â€ He noted that the majority of _Rainless Days_ was composed and recorded in about seven days, and completed over three weeks. Nelson produced the album himself and used a mastering preset created with the help of [Prophecy](http://ocremix.org/artist/4650/prophecy). The release carries a floral motif, particularly a rose on the album cover and the song titles â€œRoses in Juneâ€ and â€œSunflowersâ€. Nelson acknowledged this as being a deliberate theme. â€œFlowers are often a symbol of beauty and romance. They can also signify change, since flowers bloom, they wilt, and they die.â€

As Nelson specified, the album â€œwas performed on a Casio WK-1800 76 key keyboard, recorded to MIDI into FL studio. The samples are from Tonehammer Emotional Piano sample library.â€ Nelson has been outspoken on his views of performance versus sequenced piano, which he reaffirms when he cautiously states, â€œThe interpretation of dynamic changes during a performance isn&#8217;t supposed to mathematically follow what&#8217;s written on paper. Any experienced performer knows this and is able to give music proper rhythm and emotion during a performance. However, it&#8217;s just simply not easy to put down on a sequencer.â€ He also prefers to play an acoustic piano rather than a keyboard, but is unable to move one into his apartment for the time being. â€œI hope to upgrade my gear to a more playable MIDI controller, probably to a Yamaha KX-88.â€

Two songs on _Rainless Days_ make direct references to people with whom he has been acquainted: â€œSong for Mikuâ€ and â€œJenniâ€™s Songâ€. He explained, â€œI met Miku playing an online chat game, and kind of fell in love with her. I was going through severe depression at the time and she inspired me to actually do something about it. We had kind of a falling out later, but that&#8217;s beside the point. I met Jenni playing that same chat game, and became good friends with her.â€ He was informed of an attack that caused her to be taken to a hospital. â€œHer song was really just about how I cared about her and didn&#8217;t want to lose her. Luckily, she had a speedy recovery, and she&#8217;s fine now.â€

Nelson is an avid participant in competition compositions. He recalled the time when his interest in compos began. â€œI met [starla](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/injury/) during a Las Vegas meetup, and she told me to start participating in [One Hour Compo](http://compo.thasauce.net/compos/view/OHC). I&#8217;ve entered a few other ones in the past, just because I thought it would be fun, and I had friends who were entering to compete against. So I&#8217;ve done OHC on ThaSauce a few times; I&#8217;ve done FLMC, PRC, BEER (on OC ReMix), and a few others.â€ Although compos are generally done to hone oneâ€™s craft, he also stated that he hasn&#8217;t â€œreally participated in enough of them to improve my efficiency. If anything, I think recording this album helped improve my efficiency of creating new music.â€

He acknowledges many inspirations for his music in general. From within OCR, Nelson cites Prophecy, bLiNd, DJ Carbunk1e, FFmusic DJ, Spekkosaurus, Russell Cox, goat, Sir NutS and SgtRama. Outside the community, his influences include Rachmaninov, Beethoven, Robert Miles, TiÃ«sto, Rammstein, Danny Elfman, Nightwish, Juno Reactor, Master P, Dr. Dre, Journey, Guns Nâ€™ Roses, Enya, Nobuo Uematsu, Koji Kondo and Koichi Sugiyama.

_Rainless Days_ is available on Bandcamp to stream for free, or as a paid download. Nelson hopes that listeners will support him though his commercial release. â€œBy supporting my music you&#8217;re helping me pay rent, buy food, and make more great music. Recommend it to your friends and family too. Thanks!â€
