Claado Shou, project leader of the _Chrono Trigger_ remix project, Chrono Symphonic, stated on Thursday that he plans to release the project on September 27, 2005. The date will be the 10-year anniversary of _Chrono Trigger_&#8216;s release in North America. While the date is not yet official, Claado Shou instructed all remixers involved to complete their work as if it were.

&#8220;<span class="postbody">If you&#8217;re planning on doing a song, please have it ready to go entirely at least a few weeks prior to September 27 so it can be released accordingly,&#8221; Claado Shou said.<br /><a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=45588&#038;start=873" target="_blank"><br />http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=45588&start=873</a><br /></span>
