i got this talkbox a while back and decided to give it a go whilst covering a classic ocremix:  
The Incredible Singing Robot / Star Salzman
  
i sequenced rhodes
  
& string machine, recorded bass and cut up drumloops in Live 6 for
  
backing tracks against my improvising on the Phatty and
  
singing/scatting on the Banshee.
  
enjoy.
