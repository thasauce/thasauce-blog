Calling itself a &#8220;hybrid event that fuses together the powerful appeal of anime with the high energy entertainment of video games&#8221;, [T-MODE](http://www.tmode.org/), also known as Tournament Mode, is a anime and gaming convention in theÂ Washington, DC metro areaÂ that celebratesÂ the fusion of anime, gaming, music, cosplay, and all things otaku. This year, T-MODE will commence **this weekend, Friday, April 20th until Sunday, April 22nd**.

Yes. Yes, we know. We&#8217;re actually writing about a gaming and anime convention. However, what sets T-MODE apart from other gaming and anime conventions are the panels dedicated to chiptune and DJing by none other chiptune wunderkind [Inverse Phase](http://inversephase.bandcamp.com/) and video game DJ mastermindÂ [Dj CUTMAN](http://www.djcutman.com/). From learning how to spot fake chiptunes to being educated on the art of laptop DJing, these dudes have you covered. You can even learn how to write your own Nintendo music!

While the pre-registration deadline for T-MODE has already passed, those in the Rockville, MD area can still [register and buy tickets](http://www.tmode.org/attend/membership-rates) at the door &#8212; 1-Day and 3-Day memberships are available for $35 and $55, respectively. Don&#8217;t miss out on this cool opportunity to learn how to make and mix music from some of the pros.
