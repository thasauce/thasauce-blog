<div align="justify">
  Xaleph [formerly Carbunk1e] was finally able to get the PunBB migration tool working today, so <a href="http://www.animeremix.org/animix_forums/index.php">now we have brand-spanking-new forums</a> which will hopefully be more spam-free than phpBB was. At the very least it&#8217;s a much more lightweight forum, and it&#8217;s open source! Also, more site-integration should follow suit, so it&#8217;s not just a vanilla forum page. There is already a site skin called &#8220;nevblack&#8221; which looks more like the <a href="http://www.animeremix.org/" target="_blank">AR front page</a>. Post away!

Also, we&#8217;re still looking for more actual content, so if you&#8217;re a composer/arranger and you&#8217;re reading this, please consider submitting a tune to our site. Xaleph has a few tunes on the way, but we&#8217;d love to see some fresh new faces!
