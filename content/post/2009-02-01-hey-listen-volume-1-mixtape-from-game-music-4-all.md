  I am very happy to announce volume 1 in a series of 5 song &#8220;mixtapes&#8221; from GM4A. The series is called Hey! Listen!<br /> and asks you to do just that! The goal of these mixtapes is to<br /> introduce you to bands, musicians, and artists who you may have never<br /> discovered otherwise. These are amazing folks who deserve recognition<br /> and I hope to help them out with that the best I can from this humble<br /> corner of the internet. Each volume will include five bands as well as<br /> an up and coming artist providing the cover art. Our first collection<br /> includes songs from seal of quality, Chiptots, Lumine Hall, Alex<br /> Atchley, and Tanuki Suit Riot, and the amazing cover is brought to us<br /> by Sasha Palacio.

    About the artwork:<br /> The woman on the cover is named Haiku, Sasha gives this story about her<br /> &#8220;Haiku&#8217;s<br /> Story: Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, Haiku is a High School senior,<br /> gamer, anime fan, and artist. Her Father is a wealthy art collector and<br /> once famous Artist himself before his stroke. Her Mother is a beautiful<br /> Poet and had named Haiku after the beautiful Japanese form of poetry.<br /> Haiku&#8217;s name held beauty, strength, and deep meaning. Haiku does have a<br /> deeper meaning, little does she know, she&#8217;s the reincarnation of the<br /> famous High Priestess that guards the gates to Heaven.&#8221;
