  So, obviously, most of our readers browse OCR more than once a day, but for those not in the know, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/" target="_blank">ocremix.org</a> had a small redesign on April 9th. The site is still very much the same color. However, DJ Pretzel has incorporated more gradients and greys, and has also changed the border images. The difference is most notable on the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00001/" target="_blank">remix page</a>, and on the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/index.php" target="_blank">forums</a>.
