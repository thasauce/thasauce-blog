During the last show, I announced that I was going to be moving the show from Fridays to Saturdays, at the same time slot, because of a pending adjustment in my work schedule.  Well, this coming friday was supposed to be the last show before that happened, HOWEVER, because of an invite to a baseball game, specifically the first Phillies game since the passing of beloved personality, and legendary announcer, Harry Kalas, I will not be hosting the show Friday night, rather, I will be moving it pre-emptively to Saturdays starting this week.  This should work out in your favor if you&#8217;ve been wanting to listen in to the show.
  
Expect the same fun, weird requests, humor and news that you&#8217;ve come to
  
see from me so far.  I&#8217;m still hopeful that I will be able to take live
  
callers and live call in requests in the near future.

Here&#8217;s the upcoming schedule of events for Radio ThaSauce Live:

**Friday, April 17, 2009:** Show moved to Saturday, April 18, 2009  
**Sat. April 17, 2009:** Radio ThaSauce Live @ 8pm EST/EDT 5pm PST/PDT  
**Sat. April 25, 2009:** No show, Dyne will be on vacation  
**Sat. May 2, 2009:** The first show of May, live @ 8pm EST/EDT 5pm PST/PDT

That&#8217;s all for now!  Keep checking ThaSauce for more updates and information about Radio ThaSauce Live!
