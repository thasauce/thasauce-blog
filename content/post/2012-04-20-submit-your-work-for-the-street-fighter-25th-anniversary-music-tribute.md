Chun-Li&#8217;s killer thighs. Finally performing your first super combo. Quarter-circle forward, punch. Whether you&#8217;re a fan of _[Street Fighter](http://www.streetfighter.com/)_ or not, there&#8217;s no denying how influential this series has been in all of our lives. Â To kick off the commemoration of one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, Capcom is [opening up submissions](http://www.streetfighter.com/SF25Music/) to showcase fan music all year long:

> One of the most timeless elements of the Street Fighter series has always been the music. Whether it was the first time you heard Akuma's theme in a Super Street Fighter II Turbo arcade, or when you realized that Guile's theme went with everything, the music has inspired people around the world. Now, you have an opportunity to be a part of that musical history! We want to hear music that you've come up with. Whether you're a first time mixer, or have a full orchestra at your disposal, your music is welcome! Throughout the year, we'll be highlighting our favorite pieces, and some of them may even be utilized in our 25th Anniversary celebration activities. It's a great opportunity to have your work become a part of history!

There are no limitations to the genre or style of music, as original songs inspired by the _Street Fighter_ seriesÂ and remixes sampled from existing themes are currently being accepted. However, keep in mind that anything that you submit must be your own work and no hateful or obscene lyrics will be accepted. Also, be sureÂ upload your music to a location where it can easily be streamed, such as YouTube.Â The deadline to submit is **Friday, May 4, 2012 at 11:59 PM PST**.

If you are interested in this unique opportunity to showcase your work with a broad audience, you can fill out submission details and submit your work to Capcom [here](http://www.streetfighter.com/SF25Art/). Any artists present? Check out the [_Street Fighter_ 25th Anniversary Art Tribute](http://www.streetfighter.com/SF25Art/)Â as well.
