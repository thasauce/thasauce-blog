As we&#8217;ve [mentioned](http://thasauce.net/2012/01/31/3rd-annual-osvostoty-awards-2011-nominees-announced/) before, the winners and runner-ups ofÂ [Original Sound Version](http://www.originalsoundversion.com/)&#8216;s 3rd Annual OSVOSTOTY 2011 have been announced today Â and the results are [quite intriguing](http://www.originalsoundversion.com/3rd-annual-osvostoty-2011-awards-winners-and-runners-up-announced/). Editor-In-Chief Jayson Napolitano had many bright things to say of the artists that the OSV staff chose for this year, as he states:

> The smoke has finally cleared, and we can finally announce our winners and runners-up for our 3rd annual Original Sound Version Original Soundtrack of the Year 2011 Awards. As always, there are a few surprises, and while I know some editors are still passionately clinging to their given favorite, I think that points to the amazing quality and variety of music that was released in 2011. This year in particular saw a number of new franchises and sequels that went in radically different directions, and I think the music accurately reflects this fresh and exploratory direction.

The list of winners and runner-ups are listed after the jump. ThaSauce would also like to congratulate all of the winners and nominees of this year&#8217;sÂ 3rd Annual OSVOSTOTY 2011 Awards as well. Here&#8217;s to hoping that next year&#8217;s awards will be as exciting as ever!
