  At long last, the liner notes have arrived, in the form of a complete<br /> and total re-launch of Bremelanotide. Our album now comes in two forms:<br /> standard blue, with the seven songs you know and love, untouched, and<br /> special green, with all seven original songs plus an eighth bonus<br /> track, instrumental versions of each song including the bonus track,<br /> and lossless FLAC or super high-quality mp3 encoding. Both versions<br /> come with entirely new album art&ndash;the old art was near and dear to us,<br /> but a little too plain for the year 2008&ndash;and liner note, complete with<br /> lyrics. Best of all, you have to buy the green version.

    Not down with that? Cheer up. It&rsquo;s only $5, and we&rsquo;ll be donating all the proceeds to <a target="_blank" title="Fruitfucker for the chillinz lolz" href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>.

    Now, not only do we have the new versions of Bremelanotide for you<br /> tonight, but we also have six brand new fliers for you to print up on<br /> our flier page. Fliers two through six feature character-sheet style<br /> presentations of each member of the band, while flier seven is a<br /> beautiful photo manip, depicting photos of each member alongside an<br /> old-school cassette tape and a movie theatre ticket stub. It&rsquo;s better<br /> than it sounds.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All fliers were created and submitted by friends and fans, to whom<br /> we are totally grateful. Said gratitude manifests primarily as credits<br /> on <a href="http://thegrammarclub.com/?page_id=36">the fliers page</a>.
