<div>
  Nerdapalooza reminded me of something that I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a long time, but have never been able to do much of: PROMOTE. We got 1 run of shirts made, I got some cheap flyers and DVD cases to make stuff happen, but the funds just weren&#8217;t there to make any serious promotion.

    So this year, if at all possible, I want to be as ready for MAGFest as possible, and while adsense really isn&#8217;t going to get us all the way where we want to be, it&#8217;ll certainly help a bit. <strong>BUT WHAT&#8217;S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong>

      You&#8217;ll notice R:TS now has a DONATION button, as well. We graciously accept all donations, BUT depending on HOW much you donate,you can get some TOTALLY sweet stuff.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>$5 = ALL OF R:TS + More &#8211;</strong> R:TS doesn&#8217;t have torrents&#8230;yet (though someone did put up a torrent awhile back on TPB). So with a donation of $5 or more we&#8217;ll mail you a super snazzy DVD with all the R:TS mixes (as of July 10th), as well as some unreleased MAGFest video and some other cool stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>$25 = ALL OF R:TS + a shirt, bro &#8211;</strong> The initial run of shirts sold out&#8230;pretty much immediately, and those lucky few who got them should know that shirt is pretty much a collector&#8217;s item now, because the next run of shirts will be TOTALLY different. Now, <strong>I can&#8217;t promise you a shirt right away,</strong> because we don&#8217;t have them, and I can&#8217;t afford them right now, HOWEVER the next shipment of shirts has been designed, picked out, and are ready to be ordered. I hope to have them by MAGFest, and with a donation of $25 I absolutely GUARANTEE you will get a shirt as soon as they are availible. This means as soon as I get the BRAND NEW (totally snazzy) ThaSauce shirts with the all new logo design, you will be THE FIRST to recieve one, before they even go on sale.

          <strong>$25+ = All of R:TS, a shirt, AND unconditional love &#8211; </strong>I already love you all. To everyone that&#8217;s stuck with us from the beginning THANKS A BILLION, and I really don&#8217;t like to play favorites&#8230;but I will. Money talks, people.

          <strong>$100+ =</strong> <span class="Apple-style-span">All of R:TS, a shirt, unconditional love AND n00dz. &#8211;</span> &#8217;nuff said.
