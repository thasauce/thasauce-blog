Rayza, Aurora and Fusion2004 discuss the world of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/),
  
a community dedicated to the appreciation and restoration of video game
  
music. This week we bring you more projects, a different co-host, ReMix
  
Reviews with comments from the remixers, and more&#8230; Doug? Technical
  
issues are abound in this unlucky, yet no lesser, third episode.
