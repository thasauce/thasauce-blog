I had the chance to chat with Scott Porter, who goes by the artist name [OverCoat](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/overcoat/), about his recent release [Gardens EP](http://overcoat.bandcamp.com/). He certainly has made a name for himself in the arrangement community since he started making music in 2001; his remixes of Cave Story and Seiken Densetsu 3 appear on [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/), and he contributed to the Tales of Symphonia tribute album [Summoning of Spirits](http://tales.ocremix.org/). His new EP consists mostly of original material he composed as early as 2008.

Conceptually the EP is considered an extension of OverCoatâ€™s 2007 album [Garden Art](http://soundtempest.net/soc/album/GardenArt), and carries the same botany-themed naming system. Regarding the garden numbering, he said: â€œI imagine back then I felt like each track was like its own little garden, with its own personality and style.â€ The effect of isolated environments is evident in the first two tracks of the Gardens EP &#8212; the â€œFifteenthâ€ and â€œSixteenthâ€ gardens, respectively: track 1 offers a minimal groove and arpeggio while track 2 displays an ambient soundscape driven by percussion. OverCoat mentioned that a â€œbig breakâ€ occurred between producing those two songs, and he picked up where he left off in March 2011. The rest of the EP was composed â€œon and offâ€ within a 2-month span.

A number of tracks in the release originated as entries OverCoat made for composition competitions, or compos. He spoke about his background in the compo community. â€œI&#8217;ve been entering one hour compos since at least 2003, even hosting a lot of my own for #soundtempest and #mod_shrine on IRC. I must have at least several hundred compotunes by now.â€ He stated that he gained interest in compos through IRC, â€œsince really that&#8217;s where the whole idea came about way back in the 90s. I was in #vgmix and [virt](http://biglionmusic.com/) used to host these compos called &#8220;kwakfests&#8221; which were all general MIDI. My first one was in 2003 sometime. After 2004 I started getting into trackers and doing compos in #mod_shrine using [MODPlug](http://www.modplug.com/), and samplepacks.â€

OverCoat revealed that the Gardens EP was spurred by a particular compo theme. â€œMy first [JHCompo](http://compo.jhsounds.com/) that I did I believe the theme was &#8220;The Secret Garden&#8221; so I was like, hey â€¦ let&#8217;s make a sixteenth [garden] â€¦ and then week after week the themes just kept matching up with that album&#8217;s style in my head, so I kept going until I had about 6 tracks.â€ Once the musical content for the EP was put together, OverCoat commissioned the cover art illustrated by [Min Â´KeiiiiÂ´ Kwon](http://www.elfwood.com/~keiiii).

Aside from the original compositions, the EP includes a cover version of the [Yellow Magic Orchestra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Magic_Orchestra) song â€œEpilogueâ€ under the name â€œThe Twentieth Gardenâ€. OverCoat expressed that â€œYMO is probably my favourite band ever, and I figured it was about time I paid homage to them. I was trying to learn to play some of their songs and &#8220;Epilogue&#8221; was fun to play. So I covered that. I also felt like I needed to release a song utilizing [Vocaloid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Magic_Orchestra), and while it&#8217;s not the most creative use of the tech, I killed two birds with one stone there.â€ The synthesized vocal leads a conservative rendition that de-emphasizes the industrialized rhythm of the original â€œEpilogueâ€. The singing eventually overlaps and builds to a crescendo, signaling the end of the album.

Gardens EP is OverCoatâ€™s first commercial release, and he hopes that people from the community will support his creative endeavors. â€œI know, it&#8217;s hard to pay for something when you&#8217;ve been getting it free for so long, but I gotta start somewhere.â€
