So, now it&#8217;s been scientifically determined that the Amiga CAN beat the PC fair and square.

In the combined demo competition on The Assembly 2006 last weekend, the Amiga demo **Starstruck** by **The Black Lotus** crushed the competition and outdid all the others, which were mostly PC demos.
  

  
TBL only made 3rd place in the BreakPoint 2006 competition and
  
became quite annoyed at that &#8220;bad&#8221; result and decided to show people
  
what they&#8217;re made of, and they surely did.

Some random comments about the demo from pouët.net:

_&#8220;Wheeeeyaaa!! This one is amazing!! Überdemo!&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;holy bananas.&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;Just as disappointed as I was over their Breakpoint&#8217;06 amiga demo, just as much in awe I am of this one &#8230;&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;No words for the best amiga demo I have ever seen!&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about Amigas, but I presume this is rather awesome ;)&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;This demo rules&#8230;.the soundtrack is AWESOME.&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;holy makrel, that&#8217;s one darn good demo! fuckings for humiliating the pc scene, louie <img border="0" src="http://www.remix64.com/gfx/s51.gif" alt=":-)" />&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;have someone seen my jaws I dropped them somewhere&#8221;
  
  
&#8220;Nice one. The fact that an Amiga demo wins the demo compo in 2006 is kind of hilarious. Way to go guys! Keep the Amiga alive!&#8221;_

The soundtrack to the demo by **Olof &#8216;Blaizer&#8217; Gustafsson** will be played during the show &#8216;On Air with Ziphoid&#8217; on SLAY Radio this coming thursday as well.
