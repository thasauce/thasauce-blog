    California!

    Powerglove<br /> is finally coming to you. California has been on the top of our todo<br /> list since the very beginning, and, at long last, California and<br /> Powerglove will become one. It took us 2 years to get out to Cali, so<br /> if you want to see us try to hit one of these two dates, because who<br /> knows when we&#8217;ll be back californey-way.
