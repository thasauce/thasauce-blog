I usually do this about once a year. I actually started getting my free issues of EGM and Gaming for Windows just the other day. It may a take a few weeks to get there, but you WILL get your magazines. Definitely not a scam ðŸ˜®

        Surely you leave the house and/or office? And perhaps if your phone doesn&#8217;t support our lovely, <a href="http://m.joystiq.com/">lightweight mobile page</a>,<br /> you find yourself reaching for the comfortable contours of a print<br /> magazine. Something familiar. Something that reminds you of the days<br /> when you had little more to worry about than remembering to grab your<br /> lunchbox out of the fridge before catching the bus. Something like &#8230;<br /> EGM, which has always been there for you.

        To make sure you&#8217;re comforted in those dark times, we&#8217;ve buddied up with the good folks at Ziff once again to give away <strike>22,000</strike><br /> 45,000 (we went ahead and added some more for y&#8217;all) free 1-year<br /> subscriptions (US readers only, alas!) to their flagship gaming mag.<br /> How free? You won&#8217;t need to provide your credit card information; your<br /> subscription won&#8217;t be automatically renewed at the end of the year; and<br /> you&#8217;ll need to &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to renew your subscription before receiving any<br /> bill for the magazine. Free. Our way of saying thanks for spending your<br /> computer time with us.</div>
