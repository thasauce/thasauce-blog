Almost 24 hours ago (because it&#8217;s a bit over 12 am here), djpretzel posted a list that most certainly exposed scandals.

Over 80 mixes will be taken down before the release of the newly awaited torrents (thats right, torrent**s**). Many things will be revamped. Tags are finally freakin&#8217; fixed (you can probably tell that I&#8217;m picky about those things). Ormgas will take a hit. Why, might as well mention that apocalypse is near.
  
Take a look and see&#8230;it&#8217;s amazing to look at that list&#8230;you WILL probably find a mix that is one of your favorites, or will spur a memory because all of them are pre-1000.

I had some personal favorites in there including Bart Klepka&#8217;s Wanderer Flayer and Black Lodge&#8217;s Ocarina Boogie. Beatdrop&#8217;s Mortal Kombat Medley was the very first ocremix that I had ever listened to. Amazing. Just. Is. I can always remember (usually listening to Ormgas) hating Daknit&#8217;s songs, or realizing that cornflex (along with say&#8230;Astroboy, Ben Lewis, etc.) were simply the originals with some fancy stuff added. Hell, they didn&#8217;t even take the time to balance the volume for half the mixes.

We will remember you, OC_ReMoved&#8230;whether we hate you or not. All I can say is that I applaud djpretzel and the OCR panel for their great work. They have finally removed the worst and dysfunctional of the great OC ReMixes.

P.S.: cornflex and daknit were massively pwnt! no kidding! among many others too.
