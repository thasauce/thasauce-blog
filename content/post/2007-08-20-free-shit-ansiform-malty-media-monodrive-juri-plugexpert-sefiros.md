Lots of good stuff for you this week! My sources have pulled through to create some fantastic material. Read on to see.
  
<span class="littler"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/download/ansi038/ansi038-qetoret.mp3"><strong><span class="relno">ansiform &#8211; </span>qetoret (gong fog)</strong></a><br />Starting the column out with some great ambient. Clocking in at 16 minutes 15 seconds, it&#8217;s the longest single track on ansiform to date. Which is good, because ambience should usually last at least that long ðŸ˜€ It&#8217;s an ominously-toned track, a soundscape filled with a mix of ancient Chinese and tribal Australian textures. Highly recommended if you&#8217;re familiar with ambient or the ansiform label, also if you want to try something new and unusual. This is now one of my favorite releases from the suspiciously anonymous <a target="_blank" href="http://ansiform.afraid.org/">ansiform group</a>. I also recommend &#8220;Artroom,&#8221; &#8220;Have You Seen Me?&#8221; and the&#8221;Memories EP.&#8221; And yes, you&#8217;re not supposed to know who actually created the ambience. Personally that concept appeals to me, which is why I have a release on ansiform. Guess which one!</p> 

<p>
  <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono211.com/content/releases/mtkmp189.html">Malty Media &#8211; Bracken Bed EP</a></strong><br />h0l/Simon tells us this is a collaborative effort between familiar mono artist Aquaboogie and a &#8220;</span>long-time electronic musician and Japanese resident&#8221; Jet Jaguar. Well, right off the bat, it&#8217;s certainly an interesting combination. You&#8217;ll find that, for some reason, the EP starts off like a drunken country music performance at a cheap bar, somewhere deep in the American heartland. Malty Media, take that for what you will :). It quickly evolves into the familiar-to-monotonik-fans crazy IDM that you&#8217;d expect from someone like Khonnor, with oddball sample mangling [for texture!] being the key element of the music. The focus is on being weird in this EP, for sure, and it makes for a fun listening experience. If you enjoy this I would recommend a few other releases on Monotonik, by Grandma, Khonnor, and Gaza Faggot [hint: same person].

  <span class="song"><strong>Monodrive &#8211; Follow the Wind</strong><br /></span><img border="0" src="http://www.reunionstudio.org/images/download.jpg" /> <a href="http://www.liquiddog.net/reunion/047%20-%20Monodrive%20-%20Follow%20the%20Wind.mp3">EU Mirror</a> (thanks to GaMeBoX)<br /> <img border="0" src="http://www.reunionstudio.org/images/download.jpg" /> <a href="http://reunion.sgxmusic.com/047%20-%20Monodrive%20-%20Follow%20the%20Wind.mp3">US Mirror</a> (thanks to SGX)<br />The newest Reunion Studio release is by Monodrive. It&#8217;s labeled &#8220;dnb&#8221; but despite that, is quite subdued and more like a quick chillout, with light, airy synths and beats. &#8220;Follow the Wind&#8221; is a very suitable title for this breezy track.

  <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/jurimusic">Juri &#8211; Thought it was Love EP</a></strong><br />&#8220;This ep is similar to a short story, sad and beautiful at the same time. If you have read &#8220;White Nights&#8221; by Fyodor Dostoevsky, then you know what this is about. -Juri&#8221; Ah, Electronica / Other, the best kind of music! Even though Electronica isn&#8217;t considered the real term for electronic music [but Traxinspace and Myspace do, for some reason]. I find myself drawing comparisons to one of my own EPs, &#8220;The Sky Is Never Dark Anymore EP <a target="_blank" href="http://soundtempest.net/soc/album/oc-TheSkyisNeverDarkAnymoreEP.rar">[also free!]</a>,&#8221; which has a similar tone and style, but of course my music sounds much more &#8220;stripped down&#8221; and minimal, as usual. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not downloadable, though I asked Juri about a download and am currently waiting for a reply. For now, though, it&#8217;s available to stream on his myspace page.

  <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/details/UnderTheRoots">Sefiros &#8211; Under the Roots</a><br /></strong>Sefiros is a bit of an enigma to me. For reasons different than his music though. Actually, his music is pretty straightforward. If you want a quick description, it&#8217;s a blend of epic orchestral and electronic patterns layering and unlayering themselves at a kind of droning pace, with high quality and a full sound. This album is no different, except for the fact that this <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotacon">shota</a> version of Trent Reznor improves with every release. Give it a try.

  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.renoise.com/board/index.php?showtopic=13580"><strong>45 Min Plugexpert Backup Dj Set</strong></a><br />This is a link to the thread on the Renoise board, which contains a tracklisting and download link. If you can&#8217;t get to the board, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.savefile.com/files/949790">here&#8217;s the link</a>. Basically just a quick and dirty DJ set plugexpert mixed up to make sure there was something to play if he fucked up during a live set. Fun mix of glitch, jungle, and breakbeat.

  That&#8217;s all for this week, but boy that was a lot! It should at least last you until next Sunday night, when &#8211; who knows &#8211; my latest album might be done and [of course] freely distributed. Tell yo friendz!!!!
