Another <a href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Peoples_Remixing_Competition" target="_blank">People&#8217;s Remix Competition</a> has been underway. Hosted by reelmojo, this competition revolves around the winner <a href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Rexy" target="_self">Rexy</a>&#8216;s choice of song from <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/918766.asp?q=Katamari%20Damacy" target="_blank">Katamari Damacy</a>. You can view the whole scoop <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=77602">here</a>.

&#8221; _Course, who wouldn&#8217;t want to remix music from a game involving you
  
rolling lots of crap up into a sticky ball and sending it into the sky
  
to become a star? I understand the difficulty of most of the score
  
considering it&#8217;s mainly of a J-Pop attire, so to counterbalance it
  
we&#8217;ve gone for something mellow for this PRC&#8217;s souce material. In fact
  
it may be a little lighter than some stuff I&#8217;ve picked in the past, but
  
I hope it still works well._ &#8220;
