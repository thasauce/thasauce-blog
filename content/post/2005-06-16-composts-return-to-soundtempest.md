CompoST&#8217;s are one hour composition contests, held on IRC, in which original songs are created from a given theme. The theme is always a scenario, location, or idea from a video game that a composer might have to write when working on a game being developed. They test your speed AND your skill, so bring your best tools and your best game, but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it&#8217;s a friendly competition.
  
To participate, you simply need to show up at the scheduled time and participate, uploading your song when the hour is up. The server is **irc.esper.net** and the channel is **#soundtempest**.

Voting may or may not take place, but it&#8217;s all for fun. Usually they are held in the evenings, around 9-10PM Eastern Time, so show up a little earlier if you want to participate. One is being held tonight, June 16, 2005, at either 9 or 10 PM Eastern.Â 

P.S.: Even if you can&#8217;t make music, we&#8217;re always looking for people to vote on the entries. Come in, have a seat, hear some music.
