Lost Levels is a nerd-rock band that is being hailed as the Pink Floyd for the Nintendo generation, and, after sending a copy of their EP to Keith Stuart of the Gamesblog on Guardian.co.uk, are beginning to be noticed as a player of video game influenced music.
  
While short, the interview is a good example of outside media taking attention to Nerdcore culture, and while I haven&#8217;t heard Lost Levels, the fact that a lesser known band can send out their EP and get noticed bodes well for the more hardcore acts that perform at shows like blipfest and MAGfest.
