_Everyone in this community knows who [Rexy](http://instaidgrace.com/freqrexy/index.html) is; with her haunting piano renditions of favorite tracks, she&#8217;s rather well known. I recently had a nice chat with her, bringing about another long-awaited entry in my **Interview with a ReMixer** series. Here&#8217;s the result of an interview that almost never was. More on that afterwards._

    <p>
      <strong>Mirby:</strong> What started your interest in video game music?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Rexy</strong>: For games, I&#8217;ve always shown interest towards the visual representation and ideas pretty much since the first <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> title, though for a long time I had this strange mentality that the songs that came from the systems I played were little more than keyboard demos; not going against the likes of <a href="http://ocremix.org/artist/26/masato-nakamura">Masato Nakamura</a> or <a href="http://ocremix.org/artist/100/david-wise">Dave Wise</a> or the likes I was exposed to as a child, but that&#8217;s how they rubbed off.Ã‚Â  On a music level, I didn&#8217;t feel fully drawn into the scores themselves until around 1998, which was when my system of choice was the original PlayStation. The first score I believe I appreciated for more than just a keyboard demo was that for the original Klonoa, which had that sort of Disney movie charm that moved me just as much as the game itself. Games released later in the PS1&#8217;s lifespan, including Spyro the Dragon, Ape Escape and even the port of Final Fantasy VI also helped boost that awareness considerably, thus making me start to understand the creative decisions behind writing videogame music scores.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Ape Escape is <a title="One of my favorite tracks from this game" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2uy2-eeOD8">awesome</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: Yeah, hard to remix because it&#8217;s practically a DnB score though. ðŸ˜›
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: I would imagine. What started your interest in remixing?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: My interest kicked in not long after I discovered OverClocked Remix back in around 2003, no thanks to my research on the subject of Sonic Crackers which led to the discovery of Malcos&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="DirtyBeta" href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00480/">Dirty Beta</a>&#8220;. At around the same time, I was already taking up Saturday afternoon music tuition, which was split half-and-half between piano tutoring and handling of MIDI sequencers. So by discovering OCRemix, and seeing how the user submissions came together, I had this ambition from the start to try myself but I had no idea on what would be considered the right tools for the task. I did however keep focused on the weekend tuition, hoping that one day I&#8217;d be able to make a remix out ofÃ‚Â  my tutor&#8217;s tools, which finally happened not long after he got a copy of Reason.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Nice!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: You really got to get me to think hard about these.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Hey, it&#8217;s my journalistic duty.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: I know, not questioning anything
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: I make people use their brains. Haha. Any tracks that you&#8217;ve done that you like more or are more proud of than the others?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R:</strong> There&#8217;s definitely several highlights. Usually I tend to shy away from putting my OWN stuff on my iPod, but when stuff of mine DOES go on there, it&#8217;s usually those that I have felt the most proud of. One that I simply &#8220;like more&#8221; was the first track I ever won a PRC with, the Yoshi&#8217;s Island arrangement &#8220;<a title="Get it here!" href="http://beemp3.com/download.php?file=6217128&song=">Dream an Eastern Peace</a>&#8221; with <a title="Prophecy's page on OCR" href="http://ocremix.org/artist/4650/prophecy">Prophecy</a>; while I acknowledge now that it&#8217;s considered too liberal for some peoples&#8217; tastes, the process behind it made it a memorable experience and madeÃ‚Â  it a great experience within the electronica sub-genre.Ã‚Â  I guess &#8220;<a title="Dream Traveler" href="http://kngi.org/talesproject/site/release/disc4/407-SoS-Dream_Traveler_(Presea).mp3">Dream Traveler</a>&#8221; on Summoning of Spirits could also have gone that same way; some people might not have understood the arrangement idea behind it (with it being some hidden Klonoa tribute in Tales arrangement form), but those that did understand have interpreted the idea into a really positive way.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For those that I have an immense amount of pride over, I can easily think of three at the top of my head. Working with GrayLightning on the Castlevania: CotM remix &#8220;<a title="Time's Anxiety" href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZftKqi7JVs">Time&#8217;s Anxiety</a>&#8221; was one incredible experience, and I had known for a long time when I started out on the arrangement that he wanted to see what he can do with my writing style. The finished production on his end literally made me shiver, and with all the critical acclaim that followed it really made it pay off. &#8220;<a title="The Feather's Reflection" href="http://ocr2.blueblue.fr/files/music/albums/threshold/16%20The%20Feather's%20Reflection%20(Eagle's%20Tower)%20[Rexy].mp3">The Feather&#8217;s Reflection</a>&#8221; on Threshold of a Dream was another strong highlight, though to be fair given the track&#8217;s age I had no idea how it would stand against the current-day audience, and to be given a huge amount of critical praise there too (most notably from fellow project musician Benjamin Briggs) really boosted my confidence to the point that I sent it to the OCRemix judges&#8217; panel for feedback, as well as being one of those turning points for getting back INTO the community on a social level. And I can&#8217;t go through these &#8220;proud moments&#8221; without brining up &#8220;<a title="Hogtied" href="http://ocr2.blueblue.fr/files/music/albums/sos/09%20Hogtied.mp3">Hogtied</a>&#8221; for The Sound of Speed. I knew from the start that that would be a completely different way of arranging on my part, but my experiences through project manager halc and resulting collaboration partner Brandon Strader ultimately made me feel more receptive to newer blood and the ideas they bring over, and the fan feedback behind the track really amplified those feelings tenfold. So yes, definitely several tracks that I feel extremely happy about. lol 20 minute question.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Hehe. I do enjoy chth&#8217;s comment on The Feather&#8217;s Reflection [This being the comment: <span style="color: #000000;">Ben Briggs: &#8220;see, if (The Feather&#8217;s Reflection) had played during eagle&#8217;s tower instead of the original music, I might not have wanted to ragequit so many times&#8221; &#8211; Mirby]</span>, and I know people who agree with it. Myself included.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: You know feedback is awesome feedback if you chose to sig it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: That is true. Are there any remixers you&#8217;d like to collaborate with in the future?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: I&#8217;m personally holding out for a collab with CarboHydroM personally (!!), but I know he&#8217;s that busy he might not have time for much beyond his own personal projects. That aside, I could probably see myself working with any male vocalists or saxophone players depending on what I run into, not to mention having some temptation on working with <a href="http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/sixto-sounds/">Sixto</a> and <a href="http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/level-99/">Level 99</a>. But since most of my collaborations tend to materialise more by chance, it would actually be difficult to say where my next collaboration experiences may go.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: A very good point. Although a collab between you, Sixto, and Stevo (<a title="Sixto's interview" href="http://thasauce.net/2011/01/26/interview-with-a-remixer-sixto-sounds/">both</a> of <a title="Stevo's interview" href="http://metakirby.110mb.com/index.php?p=2_9">whom</a> I&#8217;ve interviewed before, coincidentally) would be quite epic. Do you have a favorite track from a game?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another 20 minute question? (I had waited about 15 minutes for this question; I&#8217;m keeping these in partially for comedic effect, partially as an insight into the interview process and to keep in vital text that would make no sense without this chronal context. &#8211; Mirby)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R:</strong> I find it so hard to judge BGM [background music] as they tend to cover so many different scopes depending on what you&#8217;re looking for. Most of my favorites have a tendency to have shown origins on 32-Bit systems and beyond, which have included &#8220;Blue Knife&#8221; from Bust-A-Groove, the boss music for Dr. Neo Cortex in the Crash Bandicoot series (most notably its incarnation in the third game), the Staff Roll music from the original Klonoa (part of the inspiration for &#8220;Dream Traveler&#8221; btw), the infamous Bathroom Rap from Parappa the Rapper (if only for the novelty behind it!!), and one of the most stand-alone-awesome tracks ever form that era &#8211; Gran Turismo&#8217;s &#8220;Moon Over the Castle&#8221;, which I thank <a href="http://kngi.org/">KyleJCrb</a> for raising awareness behind that track! There have also been some scores that I have shown appreciation for different reasons than listenability, including the scores for Ristar, Live-A-Live and Katamari Damacy, though like all forms of music they&#8217;re there for listening to when the time is right. Not another 20 minute question, a fucking hard one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Heh, these were written nearly two years ago. Guess I did something right back then.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: You certainly did.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: If that one was hard, get ready for the penultimate one! Do you have a favorite video game composer?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: For a long time I&#8217;ve been a sucker for the works of <a href="http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/shimomura/index.shtml">Yoko Shimomura</a> due to her ways of writing according to feeling, which is what I sometimes feel about myself as an arranger as well. The awareness with her really peaked when I started playing through the original Kingdom Hearts, and after being able to see some of her other scores since, her works in general have somewhat of a mesmerising quality to me most notably with the writing. Other composers I have shown a huge amount of appreciation for in the past have included <a href="http://www.stewartcopeland.net/">Stewart Copeland</a> from the Police (Spyro 1-4), <a href="http://www.mutato.com/redesignmp/contact.html">Mutato Muzika</a> (the Crash Bandicoot titles on the PS1, and due to Mark Mothersbaugh&#8217;s involvement it also brought in awareness for Devo!!), Spiralmouth (Crash Twinsanity), <a href="http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/sugiyama/index.shtml">Koichi Sugiyama</a> (Dragon Quest) and<a href="http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/sato/index.shtml"> Tenpei Sato</a> (the Disgaea series). A little easier, actually.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: I had no idea that the Spyro composer was from the Police.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: He played the drums.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: This means that Spyro could conceivably be linked to Kevin Bacon then.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: I wish I understood that gag. Oh wait&#8230;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M:</strong> Final question time! What do you enjoy most about remixing?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: What I enjoy most about remixing is being able to grow not only as a writer but also as a person as well. In regards to writing, one may think that they&#8217;re shoe-horned into a certain writing mentality, but by being able to branch outside of the box every now and again and experimenting with new methods, you may discover various techniques that you thought you would never have had. That to me is the way that people ideally would grow as arrangers, by being able to dive into new challenges thrown at them and see what happens. As for growth as a person, the way of life as a remixer is a very difficult and grueling process, and if you don&#8217;t toughen yourself up to both constructive criticisms and unjustified hatred then you may struggle to last long at all. I&#8217;m still not the most emotionally stable person in the world either, but by knowing about the mature mindset, getting along with other arrangers and site members, and just having fun about your writing, that kind of cooperation would make you feel both safe and secure in regards to writing. In other words, I enjoy mixing because of the wonderful community at large, and all the pursuits that can ultimately emerge from it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Everyone seems to love it for the community, and no surprise; it&#8217;s a great community. And it&#8217;s all thanks to Lord Pretzel&#8230; oh wait&#8230;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: The OC ReMix community, definitely. ðŸ™‚
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: The greater community is also pretty nice too&#8230;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: Yeah, bit of a shame that VGmix is out of the picture though&#8230; But alas, thank you very much Mirby! Good timing too, because I gotta run for the bus!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: It&#8217;ll be reborn as something new, I&#8217;m sure. Well, thanks for your time. This has been one of my longer interviews but it was fun.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: Not a problem, it was definitely a firm process.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>M</strong>: Also, the only other person who had to leave quickly at the end was djpretzel. Leave with that on your mind. Thanks again!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>R</strong>: No idea you interviewed djp, but I&#8217;ll see some of your other interviews during lunch hour if I can. Cheers!</div>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was a rather fun interview too, but alas my IRC app didn&#8217;t save the log so this almost never was pasted. Thankfully, Rexy gave me the log, so now you all get to read the awesomeness! You can read more about her at her artist profile <a title="Rexy's page here on ThaSauce" href="http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/rexy/">Viewing Artist: Rexy</a>. Until next time, game on!!
