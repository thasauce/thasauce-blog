_&#8220;This week on the show all about the music and community of_ [_OverClocked ReMix_](http://www.ocremix.org/)_:</p> 

Vee gee dee jay&#8217;s on a roll! Despite our inability to release a show last week, you guys stood by us like shadows. Watched over us like angels. Stuck to us like peanut butter on the roofs of our mouths! And all kidding aside, we really do appreciate the votes.</em>
  
_In turn, we feel obliged to offer you: Rama, DrumUltimA, Cyan_Ide, and a whopping three ReMix Reviews. Do what you may (seriously, go wild) with these precious gifts. And we&#8217;re just getting warmed up! Don&#8217;t forget that next week will be our special HAPPY BIRTHDAY VGDJ EPISODE, with many a special guest- including the folks from the VGDJ anniversary UK meetup in London. Enjoyyyy&#8230; ^o^&#8221;
