excerpt: 'Can we just say two words? Mashup. Galore. <i>Indie Mashup EP: Sharing is
  Caring</i>  attempts to take a rather ''modern'' take on classic indie music from

  of Heaven, and more. With solid remixes from reputed artists within the community
  like A_Rival, Module, & Disasterpeace, we''d say that this 11-track EP succeeds
  at showcasing the vast reach of creativity within the VGM scene.'

Can we just say two words? Mashup. Galore. Mixed by theÂ [amazing](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/17/howard-drossin-backs-up-splatterhouse-remixes/) [Chris Geehan](http://hyperduck.co.uk/),Â _Indie Mashup EP: Sharing is Caring_ attempts to take a rather &#8216;modern&#8217; take on classic indie music from such games asÂ _Aquaria, Sword and Sworcery, To the Moon, Jamestown, Shatter, Tower of Heaven_, and more. With solid remixes from reputed artists within the community like [A_Rival](http://blog.planetskill.com/), [Module](http://www.module.co.nz/), & [Disasterpeace](http://disasterpeace.com/), we&#8217;d say that this 11-track EP succeeds at showcasing the vast reach of creativity within the VGM scene. Francisco Cerda&#8217;s &#8220;DARK STAR&#8221; provides a particularly haunting, yet amazing orchestral renditionÂ Jim Guthrie&#8217;s original &#8220;Lone Star&#8221; while Module&#8217;s &#8220;Mutant Jazz Space Babies Remix&#8221; proves to be the ultimate groovy, chill-out session of aÂ _Sword and Sorcery_ original.

While we&#8217;ve embedded the albumÂ above to give you a quick preview,Â _Indie Mashup EP: Sharing is Caring_ is available exclusively on [Game Music Bundle](http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/)Â in a Pay-What-You-Want format.
