With her recent collaboration with brilliant composers Akira Yamaoka and Woody Jackson to help create [a charity album](http://playforjapan.org/album/) for Japanese tsunami and earthquake victims and the [considerable attention](http://thasauce.net/2011/07/01/plants-vs-zombies-medley-recreated-with-four-gu-zheng-rad-video/) being paid to her work, [Laura Shigihara](http://shigi.wordpress.com/) has been quite the busy bee lately.Â  Even so, this lovely lady still has time to produce soulful, enchanting tunes that are probably capable of rendering even the cruelest war-waging cyborgs useless. Written for Ken â€œReivesâ€ Gao's upcoming adventure game _[To The Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1MFKfGhI5g),_ the acclaimed Plants vs. Zombies composer has delivered yet another delightful gem to add to her continued success &#8212; make sure you click the play button above to listen to Laura's new original song, â€œEverything's Alrightâ€.
