For those who didn&#8217;t attend MAGFest X, otherwise known as [one of the largest video game music festivals in the country](http://magfest.org/), we will be posting a few exclusive videos over the next few days to recap one of the best VGM events of the year. Among our favorite moments this year is a short clip of Ellen McLain&#8217;s wonderful singalong of her smash hit, &#8220;Want You Gone&#8221; with her husband John Patrick Lowrie, a fellow voice actor and overall awesome dude who happens to play a banjo. Nevermind the fact that Mrs. McLain has won [numerous](http://www.spike.com/events/video-game-awards-2011-nominees/voting/best-performance-by-a-human-female) [awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Achievement_Awards#Character_Performance) for her performances as GLaDOS from the highly favored _Portal_ series. Although most of us are familiar with her wonderful voice performances in acclaimed Valve games such as _Half-Life 2_ and _Team Fortress,_ EllenÂ McLain is also an established opera singer.
