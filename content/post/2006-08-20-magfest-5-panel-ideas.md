Fellow gamers,
  
Fellow rocker-outters,
  
Lend us your recommendations.
  
We want to know which panels you especially enjoyed last year, and
  
which ones you think we should ditch. We are doing a few new cool ones
  
this year (jump on IRC or send Brendan a message on AIM to hear more)
  
and we also have some space that can be used for smaller (non-band)
  
music fun.

Did you ever want to see a panel on some random thing but thought it
  
was a bit too farfetched? Are you interested in helping out with that
  
or an already-existing panel? Here&#8217;s your chance! Let us know!
