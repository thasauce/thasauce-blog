  So we know that we've been sort of MIA the past couple of weeks. And we know how hard it was for you to miss ThaSauce, especially for all that hard work that we do gathering the latest VGM news. ...Well, maybe not. In any case, we're back! To celebrate our return, we've decided to show you Brandon Strader's epic metal remix of <i>TESV: Skyrim</i>'s "Age of Aggression"  in all its fantastic glory, visuals and all.
