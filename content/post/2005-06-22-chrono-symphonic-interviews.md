As you know, Chrono Symphonic is a project to rework some of CT&#8217;s
  
greatest music into orchestral scores to accompany a movie script
  
Claado Shou has written. Since October, it&#8217;s attracted several great
  
remixers, and new faces have joined with very promising tracks as well.
  
Over the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve collected a bunch of interviews for a
  
sort of &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; look at what&#8217;s going on, and a lot of
  
remixers are featured. Don&#8217;t miss it!
