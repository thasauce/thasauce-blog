Remix extraordinaires [RAC](http://remixartistcollective.com/) have just released the long-awaited _Nintendo vs. Sega II_. RAC, also known as the **Remix Artist Collective**, formed as the brainchild of AndrÃ© Allen Anjos in 2007 to resist the typical club mix paradigm that became prevalent in the early â€˜00s. RAC is also noted for showcasing indie remixes that have received significant attention from various high-traffic review sites. RAC has earned special place here at ThaSauce by adding their own special touch to each song that implies intense focus and a careful ear to traditional 8-bit sounds. Known for adding fun, upbeat electronic instrumentation and sassy flair to the classics of both platforms, _Nintendo vs. Sega II_ definitely highlights a rather refreshing perspective to video game remixes. You can download their album for free [here](http://remixartistcollective.com/nintendo-vs-sega-2).
