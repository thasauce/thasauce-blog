From his thread on OCR:

<span class="postbody">&#8220;<em>I just got word from the agent who booked the<br /> October 21st MC F and Optimus Rhyme show at Crash Mansion that, if I<br /> can draw 40 or more people to my show next Thursday, September 21st, at<br /> Fat Baby in New York City, she could give me a shot at opening for the<br /> aformentioned rappers at the aformentioned October 21st performance. </em></span>
  
_<span class="postbody"><br /> This would be my first weekend show and a signifigant step up in terms<br /> of venue size from the two I will have played previously (Club Midway;<br /> Fat Baby). </p> 

<p>
  SO, if you live in or can travel to New York and know or are 40 people,<br /> PLEASE OH PLEASE come see me next Thursday at Fat Baby, and tell them<br /> you&#8217;re there to see me at the door, or they might think you&#8217;re there to<br /> see some band with real drums, some band like The Sexy Champions, who<br /> I&#8217;m playing before.
</p>

<p>
  In conclusion, get your ass to here:
