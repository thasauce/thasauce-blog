VGDJ Episode 004 is now available at <a href="http://www.vgdj.net" target="_blank">http://www.vgdj.net</a>

Rayza and Aurora discuss the world of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/), a community dedicated to
  
the appreciation and restoration of video game music. This week: INTERVIEW with
  
djpretzel himself. Pretz gives us the scoop on his latest mixes, upcoming
  
projects and his musical influences, as well as his motivation for creating the
  
site and keeping it a success. Aurora&#8217;s home from her 2-week west coast stint
  
and Rayza talks about deceased avian creatures. Rayza also pimps the Unmod
  
Videogame Review thread and a website dedicated to music from the Amiga system.
  
Remix Reviews of djpretzel, Darangen and PriZm, and of course, the Russian ReMix
  
Roulette.
