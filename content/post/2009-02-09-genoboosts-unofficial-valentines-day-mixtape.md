  So<br /> I have hastily tossed together a quick mix of love songs for all the<br /> nerds and your significant others to enjoy! And I hope you do. If you<br /> decide to play this for them, definitely let me know how that went in<br /> the comments!Also, since I don&#8217;t really have permission to be<br /> releasing these tracks I will only be having this compilation available<br /> until the end of February, so grab the songs while you can! Most of the<br /> songs on this mix are free and in higher quality from each respective<br /> artist, so definitely check out each artists website!
