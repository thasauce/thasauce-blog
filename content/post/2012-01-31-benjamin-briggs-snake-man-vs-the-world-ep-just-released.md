Hot snake man action. Only [Benjamin Briggs](https://www.facebook.com/bbriggsmusic) would use these four words to describe his newly released EP, _Snake Man vs. The World._ Since taking the time out to [review his last big release](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/19/triple-review-benjamin-briggs-protodome-and-willrock/), we know that Benjamin Briggs really shells out big on his releases. This EP is no exception.Â Initially byproducts of [Darkesword&#8217;s team-based competition Wily Castle Remix Gauntlet 2011](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=37157), Mr. Briggs has stuck with a solid Snake Man theme that has remained delightfully consistent throughout the album. Released as-is, we would definitely compare theseÂ four new Mega Man remixes to a sexy, hyperactive electronic smorgasbord of awesome beats that we simply can&#8217;t get out of our heads.

_Snake Man vs. The World_ isÂ [available now for free onÂ Bandcamp](http://bbriggs.halc9bit.com/releases), but feel free to [donate to Mr. Briggs](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=0VoyTBhYuyjxCvrDhurx2ovd7TEYJzspcYvh4nu5Q-hWUpVLiJQ4-YgT190&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d4026841ac68a446f69dad17fb2afeca3) as a token of your appreciation. We&#8217;ve also included a few of our favorites from the EP for your aural pleasure below.
