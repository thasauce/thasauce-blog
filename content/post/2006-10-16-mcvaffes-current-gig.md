<span class="postbody">Quoted from McVaffe&#8217;s post on the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=93450" target="_blank">OCReMix Forums</a><br /> &#8220;<em>OK I&#8217;m not particularly proud of shameless plugs<br /> but considering all I&#8217;ve learned from this site had quite a bit to do<br /> with me actually landing this gig I figured it&#8217;d be at least decent of<br /> me to give a heads up to anyone interested.</em>&#8221; </span>
  
<span class="postbody">&#8220;<em>I&#8217;ve been working with a small game development company in downtown NYC<br /> on an Xbox 360 title and it&#8217;s almost completed. The name of the game is<br /> Street Trace NYC and I&#8217;m not going to promise it&#8217;s teh B3ST GAM3<br /> EV4R!!! But considering it&#8217;s a completely original Live Arcade game and<br /> is completely 3D, it&#8217;s pretty damn impressive. As for the concept, I<br /> guess you could call it a cross between ideas of Tricstyle and Twisted<br /> Metal, but it&#8217;s definitely a fun multiplayer game (though I haven&#8217;t<br /> gotten particularly good at it yet). </p> 

<p>
  As for my involvement, I worked on some of the sound effects as well as<br /> the in-game music, which, despite the small size of the game, is still<br /> a great accomplishment for me. Even before the game officially comes<br /> out I wanted to give a shout to the site and to its members for giving<br /> me an outlet for my stuff and encouraging me long enough to even get to<br /> this point.
</p>

<p>
  For anyone wanting to check out the game itself the site can be found here:

  The pics are a bit dated and right now the game is actully cel- shaded<br /> and looking much better, but you can get the idea. I don&#8217;t know what<br /> will happen after this project but I look forward to working on future<br /> projects with this talented group of developers, so please check it<br /> out, especially if you like the whole racing / shooting genre.

  And again, thanks guys!! (and gals)</em>&#8221;
