Recently, Wintermute participated in a contest called the &#8220;RPM Challenge&#8221;.Â  I&#8217;ve quoted his post over at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?p=527590#527590">OC Remix Forums</a> for you to read:

  Good afternoon, OCReMix!<br /> I recently participated in the RPM Challenge (<a href="http://www.rpmchallenge.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.rpmchallenge.com/index.php</a>).<br /> For those not familiar with it, the basic premise is that you create an<br /> album&#8217;s worth of original music within the month of Februrary. Starting<br /> on February 1st and ending (rushed!) the night of the 28th, I created<br /> an album entitled &#8220;Audivore,&#8221; which I have since decided to make freely<br /> available for download.<br /> <a href="http://www.danbruington.com/music/audivore.zip" target="_blank"><br /></a>

  <a href="http://www.danbruington.com/music/audivore.zip" target="_blank">http://www.danbruington.com/music/audivore.zip</a><br /> Stats:<br /> 8 tracks<br /> 35 minutes, 42 seconds<br /> Electronica</p> 
  
  <p>
    I had a lot of fun trying to work in such a short time frame. The<br /> production got a little rushed at the end, which was one of the major<br /> factors in deciding that it should be released for free.

    I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it.
