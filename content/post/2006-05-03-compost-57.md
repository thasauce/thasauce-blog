  CompoST 57 happened today! Entrants were myself, Tyler Heath, Marou [formerly Catlein], mDuo13, and Argitoth. There was no voting, however I simply decided Argitoth&#8217;s was the most fitting piece. The theme was &#8220;Laboratory,&#8221; a theme that describes, well, a laboratory. Chemicals, computers, experiments, and machinery.
