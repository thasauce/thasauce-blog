hunz says, &#8220;<span class="blacktextnb10">Hey,</p> 

<p>
  Just a quick msg to say my official web page is online. <a href="http://www.hunz.com.au/" target="_blank">www.hunz.com.au</a>. There is a new track to download called &#8220;you should never change&#8221; that will not be featured on my album. There is new video clips to download from past work I&#8217;ve been involved with so please download, listen and watch. Feel free to leave comments. I also spent a bit of time on the art work which is a small reflection of what&#8217;s on the album. It&#8217;s like graffiti but it uses real photography to to trace over.</span><br /> <span class="blacktextnb10">Thanks everyone,<br />..::hunz..&#8221;</p>
