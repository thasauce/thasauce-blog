Today, adhesive_boy unveiled the existance of an <a href="http://eb.dackz.net" target="_self">experimental earthbound remix project</a>.
  
In production secretly since late March, the unfinished project
  
features such artists as adhesive_boy, binster, housethegrate, Children
  
of the Monkey Machine, dackz (shadow), zyko, Mazedude, Shnabubula and
  
many others.
  
The experimental nature of the project lies with the synthesis of short
  
arrangements (two to three minutes in length) into a single flowing
  
production (somewhat like Relics of the Chozo). 

Feel free to browse <a href="http://eb.dackz.net" target="_self">our site</a> to see what we&#8217;ve been working on these past months.
