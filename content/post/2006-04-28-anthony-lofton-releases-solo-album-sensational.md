A member of the OneUps over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oneupstudios.com">OneUp Studios</a>, Anthony Lofton (saxophone), has released an original album that has been in the works for some time.
  
In a post on the OUS boards, Anthony writes:

&#8220;_A CD I have
  
been working on for a while has finally been released. The title is
  
&#8216;Sensational&#8217; and though it may not be game music, it is all original
  
work from me. The genre of the songs feature Smooth Jazz, RnB, House,
  
Latin. You can check out some demos on my website at <a href="http://www.anthonylofton.com" target="_blank">http://www.anthonylofton.com</a>._&#8220;_</p> 

</em>If you enjoy saxophone music, or are just a fan of the OneUps, this is definately worth buying.
