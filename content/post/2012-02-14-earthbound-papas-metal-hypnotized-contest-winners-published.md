  You might remember the EARTHBOUND PAPAS contest we mentioned a few weeks back that invited EBP fans to remix or arrange their hit single "Metal Hypnotized". As excited as we were to see the winning submissions of the contest, we were elated to find out that one of ThaSauce's very own featured artists has been chosen to be a guest performer on the next EBP album!

</center>You might remember the EARTHBOUND PAPAS contest

[Â we mentioned a few weeks back](http://thasauce.net/2012/01/17/earthbound-papas-present-metal-hypnotized-remixarrange-contest/)Â that invited EBP fans to remix or arrange their hit single &#8220;Metal Hypnotized&#8221;. According to contest rules, there were no limitations toÂ _howÂ _you can actually remix or arrange this song, as instrumentals and lyrics could be played or replaced with other members.Â Â The EBP themselves also listened to each submitted track in order to choose the winners that were officially announced today.

As excited as we were to see theÂ [winning submissions of the contest](http://www.dogearrecords.com/Earthbound_Papas/arrange.html), we were elated to find out that one of ThaSauce&#8217;s very own featured artists has been chosen to be a guest performer on the next EARTHBOUND PAPAS album. As shown above,Â [Tony Dickinson,](http://tonydickinson.net/) also known as [Prince of Darkness](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/prince-of-darkness/), single-handedly transforms &#8220;Metal Hypnotized&#8221; into his own metal symphony with a nice touch of epic shredding that puts even the best metal bands to shame.Â Other notable entries (like [this great 8-bit interpretation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jth6QnuM6HI#!) by Nikola Whallon or [this piano composition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=o-j2yj9uIQY#at=25) by eba9production) were also rewarded with special autographed prizes from EARTHBOUND PAPAS.

ThaSauce would like to congratulate Tony Dickinson and [the rest of the EBP contest participants](http://www.youtube.com/video_response_view_all?v=ls-GPW-6hMs) who entered in the contest. Thanks for taking time out to create such incredible interpretations for one of our favorite EBP songs!
