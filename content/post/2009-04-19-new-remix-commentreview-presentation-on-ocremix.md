  In the spirit of making <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=22786">April kick as much ass as possible</a></strong>, we&#8217;ve gone live with a modified <strong>ReMix detail page that incorporates comments RIGHT on the page itself</strong>, in a blog/youtube style. You can still get to the full review thread, and in fact <em>need</em><br /> to in order to reply, but if you&#8217;re just browsing the latest 15<br /> comments, you don&#8217;t need to leave the main mix page. We plan to do the<br /> same thing for albums.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Example: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01830/">http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01830/</a></div>

      I&#8217;m still working on the code that parses/cleans up BBcode, so you&#8217;ll<br /> see some formatting inconsistencies with URL, quote, and other<br /> elements, but in general the comments should be intelligible.<br /> <strong><br /> I personally prefer things this way as I feel it highlights the awesome<br /> feedback OA, DragonAvenger, Marmiduke, Polo, Dhsu, and many others<br /> provide for so many mixes. Hopefully it will encourage others to do the<br /> same.</strong></p> 
      
      <p>
        So, what do YOU think? Post your thoughts on this change here &#8211; do keep<br /> in mind that, as stated, I&#8217;m still working on the text formatting, so<br /> pointing that out isn&#8217;t necessary.
