From the VGDJ website, &ldquo;Can you believe it&#8217;s been FIFTY episodes of VGDJ?! Time flies when you&#8217;re having fun, I guess! The show has certainly gone through a lot of changes since episode #001, from the hosts, to the way it&#8217;s been edited, to the segments on each episode&#8230; even to the design of the site. But in the end, fifty episodes later, it&#8217;s still the same at heart. So, we&#8217;ve put together a very special show for you loyal listeners (and there are quite a few more of you now!) in celebration of this landmark. While it took a little longer to polish up, there was good reason&#8230; But you&#8217;ll have to listen to find out!!!
