I&#8217;ve taken this time to add McVaffe&#8217;s website, <a href="http://anosou.com/" target="_self">as well as Anosou&#8217;s</a>, to <a href="artists.php" target="_blank">the Artists tab on ThaSauce</a>. I&#8217;ll be looking for more artist blogs and websites to add to the pages soon, and if you have any suggestions, be sure to let me know.
