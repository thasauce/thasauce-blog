  CompoST 60 happened today! Not as good of a turnout today as I&#8217;d hoped, but I still had fun. The theme was &#8220;Alien hive,&#8221; so like certain parts of the original Metroid or Prime, or perhaps even the Zerg music from StarCraft, who doesn&#8217;t love that :)? Anyway, the entrants were myself, Xerol, D-Lux, and Suzumebachi. There was no voting this time.

    I tried going for the zerg approach, of course, because that&#8217;s the music that&#8217;s been running through my head these past few days. During the compo I had some complications so I didn&#8217;t get all the ideas down that I wanted to do.

    D-Lux&#8217;s is obviously humor, though he was on the right track towards a good melody.

    Xerol&#8217;s was pretty neat, though it would have worked well as a short loop, since that&#8217;s basically what it is, repeated a few times. But it&#8217;s an interesting take on the theme. And a very erotic title.

    Suzu&#8217;s reminded me more of the Protoss than anything ðŸ˜€ only more &#8220;street-smart&#8221; or whatever. Wrong kind of alien, but the quality was okay.</div>
