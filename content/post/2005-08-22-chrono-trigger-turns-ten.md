Ten years ago, Chrono Trigger was released in the USA, securing it as a
  
legend of RPGs and an extraordinary game. Now, three hundred remixes,
  
ten years, and countless fan projects later, Chrono Trigger&#8217;s release
  
is once more celebrated in a big, big way. While I will be posting
  
expanded links on Chrono / remix gaming forums, all the new stuff can
  
be accessed through one page. Along with all the new features and gifts
  
are **four new bLiNd Chrono covers**; don&#8217;t miss them! Direct your attention, if you will to <a target="_self" href="http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_10th_Birthday">http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_10th_Birthday</a>

Have fun everyone! Here&#8217;s to another ten years!
