    I&#8217;ve decided to finally release an album. Now it&#8217;s not done yet, but I have suffered long enough from the it&#8217;s-not-done-itis. I figure I can grab between 10 and 16 tracks, mostly from my recent compos, and others from songs that have never been released.

    I need you guys to bug me and make sure that I don&#8217;t give up on this, and that I don&#8217;t dawdle on other things too much. Since most of the composing part is complete and all that is left is rerecording and finishing up the backing tracks, it is certainly possible to see something completed come Magfest. Thank you for all your continued support!
