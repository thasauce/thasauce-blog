CONGRATULATIONS TO PIXIETRICKS AND BIG GIANT CIRCLES! The two are now official OCR judges!
  
The two prominent remixers, pixietricks and Big Giant Circles, are quite well known. pixietricks, aka Jillian Goldin is currently in her third undergraduate year at the Peabody Conservatory. Big Giant Circles, aka Jimmy Hinson, was recently married a while ago. Congratulations to the two because they deserve it and are very, very good remixers who have set the bar high for incoming OCReMixers (heh, including myself ><).
