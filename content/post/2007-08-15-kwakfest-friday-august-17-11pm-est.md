With <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgmix.com/vg25/viewtopic.php?id=7513">plenty of warning</a> this time, no one has an excuse to miss out on this kwakfest. Just be on [IRC](irc://irc.vgmix.com/kwakfest) at the time and be ready to make a midi fitting the theme. And, as virt says, all excuses are stupid.
