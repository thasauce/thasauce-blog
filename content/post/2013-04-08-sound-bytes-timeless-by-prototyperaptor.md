_Timeless_ is the first track onÂ PrototypeRaptor&#8217;s sophomore album,Â _Nostalgiarithm_.

> The album spans multiple genres at around a 70 minute runtime, including 130 bpm electro house like this track, old school prog house, experimental dubstep, ambient works, and includes most of the track IDs I&#8217;ve been playing out/putting in sets here on SC.
