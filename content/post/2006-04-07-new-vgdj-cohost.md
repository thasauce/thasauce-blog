_&#8220;Ahem! Announcing VGDJ&#8217;s newest cohost&#8230;</p> 

Mr. Andrew &#8220;Zircon&#8221; Aversa!Â [&#8230;] As a remixer, mod, and judge, Zircon couldn&#8217;t be more on top of the scene. His dedication should speak for itself, but just in case it doesn&#8217;t&#8230; He&#8217;s one heck of a dude. With a history of busy cohosts, I&#8217;m more than relieved that we&#8217;re gonna have someone as dependable as Andrew around. Not to mention that we have actually met (and bonded, like seriously!) in real life, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to working together!</em>
  
_Zircon goes to school in Philly and lives in New York, which are both managable distances from my own school and home locations, so don&#8217;t be surprised if we cook up something special for the near future.</p> 

Anyway, I know some of you may be missing Wangless, but hey- life goes on. I think every host brings something different to the show, and I&#8217;m certainly looking at this as positive change. John had a great radio presence, for sure, but he couldn&#8217;t devote enough time to VGDJ: didn&#8217;t want to receive or reply to the emails, hardly ever showed up in our IRC chat, etc. We&#8217;re gonna make this a real team effort again, just like the good ol&#8217; days. So please extend your warmest welcomes toooooo Ziiiirrrcccoooonnn! ^_^

P.S. We&#8217;re shooting for an episode this coming Monday, but can&#8217;t say for sure until we figure out some mic quality stuffs.&#8221;</em>
