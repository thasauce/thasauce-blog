    Of all the performers in the worldwide chipmusic scene, very few can match the flair and spectacle of San Francisco&rsquo;s chip-hop king, A_Rival (aka Wave Theory, AE, Planet Skill, etc). In his latest album,ï¿½<em>8-Bit Pimp</em>, Rival stages a 2A03-powered assault on your ear drums, spitting rapid-fire rhymes with impeccable cadence atop some of the dopest 8-bit beats you&rsquo;ve ever heard.

    And while I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of chipmusic that defaults to videogames as a unifying theme, jams like &lsquo;Cybernetic Mariachi&rsquo; and &lsquo;Show Me Girl&rsquo; tell entertaining and humorous stories while showcasing a masterful mix of chip sounds, guitars, synth and vocals. The production quality is top-notch and so are the rhymes; an exceptional release that West Coast chip fans can take pride in.

    If you&rsquo;re just hearing Rival&rsquo;s stuff for the first time and you&rsquo;re not going to be atï¿½<a href="http://paxsite.com/">PAX East</a>later this month, you&rsquo;re missing out, as this fella puts on one heck of live show. Fortunately,ï¿½<em>8-Bit Pimp</em>ï¿½should give you a pretty solid idea of the fresh sound A_Rival brings to the stage. And if you were atï¿½<a href="http://magfest.org/" rel="nofollow">MAGFest</a>ï¿½this year, you can join me in interjecting with that bad-ass Colossus roar during the title track&rsquo;s chorus. I&rsquo;m telling you, that meme never gets old.
