    Hey everyone! Just relaying a message from everyone&#8217;s favourite band&#8230; THE SMASH BROTHERS!!!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Smash Brothers have <em>finally</em> pulled it together and<br /> gotten a web site going. Now experience their bacon-infused goodness &#8211;<br /> without the smell of bacon &#8211; in the privacy and comfort of your own<br /> living quarters.

    This wicked-cool web presence (put together by the ridiculously awesome<br /> Mazedude) contains generic information, band member bios, and links to<br /> samples from OUR BRAND NEW EP kids. The EP is being printed right this very moment and will be<br /> available at MAGFest. We are only doing a very small run of this one,<br /> however, so make sure to swing by our table and pick up a copy. Five<br /> Dollars, Six Songs. Bargain bin prices! We won&#8217;t be undersold!
