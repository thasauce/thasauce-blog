  ReMix:ThaSauce goes live!
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  What is this thing? R:TS is a new video game arrangement<br /> site brought to you by the creators of ThaSauce. Our goal is to put the fun<br /> back into arrangement. We believe that some are placing too much emphasis on sample<br /> quality and production levels, rather than focusing on arrangement and<br /> enjoyment.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  What about it? R:TS uses a submission system similar to<br /> classic OverClocked ReMix. Submissions are evaluated by a small group of 2-3 &ldquo;arbiters&rdquo;,<br /> who each have the power to approve a song. Basically all it takes is one &ldquo;yes&rdquo;<br /> vote.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Who is it? R:TS was created by Suzumebachi, Fusion2004, and<br /> designed by Eon Blue under the direction of SgtRama. The current arbiters are<br /> SgtRama, Xerol, and Suzumebachi.

  Schwat? Send us your songs, remixers! The site itself is<br /> still currently under construction, but all the core features are there, as<br /> well as information on submitting your works to us!
