OCReMix has a lot of remixes from Mega Man 3, a very popular Mega Man game. Some remix WIPs of this game are never released and have disappeared from the Earth. It&#8217;s not good, some of these WIPs are very nice. Here is an old WIP, released around 2004:

  It&#8217;s a song from Whipper, an unknown remixer. It&#8217;s his only support to the OCReMix community. He did some other songs, but these songs aren&#8217;t good, they aren&#8217;t VG remixes and they aren&#8217;t even 50% finished. Whipper is not active anymore, so I don&#8217;t think he will finish this trancy remix.</p>

    It is a trance remix from Mega Man 3 Magnet Man Theme. Magnet Man is not the most remixed song, especially not in this way. Check out the song and enjoy.
