<div align="justify">
  The theme today was &#8220;Abandoned Spaceship!&#8221; We also had two new faces, Illustrationism [the owner of Sakari-Infinity] and Koelsch1 [scene saxophonist extraordinaire!]. Thanks to my recent camping out in #mod_shrine, I came across a tool called &#8220;CMS&#8221; designed specifically for managing compos, by Reduz! It&#8217;s great, I&#8217;ll give it to you if you ask for it.</p> 
  
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://compost.lggaming.com/compost64/Results.txt">Here are the Results</a></div> 
    
    <p>
      CompoSTs [short for<br /> Compo and SoundTempest put together :)] are thematic videogame music<br /> OHCs, held in #soundtempest on EsperNet. They are scheduled whenever<br /> anyone feels like compoing.
    </p>
    
    <div align="justify">
      Formats allowed are music modules [it,s3m,xm,mod], NSF, mp3, and ogg.</p> 
      
      <p>
        I<br /> host the CompoSTs personally and also participate. I pick the theme and<br /> regulate the start and end time. I also decide whether the channel<br /> votes on a winner or not [sometimes when I am tired, there is no voting<br /> :)]
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Come hang out in #soundtempest, and please let me know if/when you would like to have one.
