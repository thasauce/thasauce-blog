From the VGDJ Website, &#8220;Remember when we said something about small shows balancing big ones? Well&#8230; oops. We might be between special episodes, but hey, we love you guys enough that we don&#8217;t mind givin&#8217; ya a bigger one this week just for kicks (just remember to [vote for us](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140), as it&#8217;s a new month).
  
Listen in and find out the answers to such deep questions as: what does
  
a Solitaire ReMix sound like? What&#8217;s a periodontal cyst? Why do people
  
call us without leaving a name? And of course, is it possible to have _four_ reports on a single show? Hurry! To the download button!
