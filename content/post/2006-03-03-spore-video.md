As seen on [Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&q=spore), Will Wright talks about the upcoming game &#8216;Spore&#8217; at the Game Developer&#8217;s Conference. While a good amount of the narration is about the technical side of it (these &#8220;Procedural Verbs&#8221; sound interesting) it also gives a good look at the game itself, showing how you start from a microcellular organism and evolve into a species, and spread out across your continent, planet, solar system, and even galaxy. While an exact release date hasn&#8217;t been given, speculation puts it at around Fall 2006.
