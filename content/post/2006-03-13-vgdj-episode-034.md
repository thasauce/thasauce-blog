This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/): 

We&#8217;re spicing it up here at VGDJ, with a little website facelift, \*tripple\* remixer birthdayage, a fresh batch of Bun Bun&#8217;s, and the dig on Play! A Video Game Symphony straight from our resident Chicagoan. The intro contest plows on as Wingless leaks his secret plot to punch Jeremy Seol in the face&#8230;among other things&#8230; Get it all on this PixieMixalicious (try saying _that_ five times fast) episode!
