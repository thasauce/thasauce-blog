[Siamey]() has recently released a demo of a track he&#8217;s been working on which is a remix of &#8220;He&#8217;s a Pirate&#8221; from Pirates of the Caribbean.
  
Siamey wrote on his [thread @ OCR]():

_Hi all</p> 

This is a small demo of a project ive been kicking around the office for almost a year now.

I took the song &#8220;He&#8217;s a Pirate&#8221; from Pirates of the Caribbean, and
  
changed its many themes from 3/4 to 4/4, and then proceeded to throw it
  
into a trance format.

The original song was written by Klaus Badelt, with some direction by Hans Zimmer&#8230;

wow.. look what i just found out, Disney just hired Tiesto to remix this song aswell. well.. damn&#8230;

ENJOY!

EDIT: No that is not a NordLead, that is a creation of my own using
  
Subtractor. What a question&#8230; it sounds nothing like a NordLead!</em>
