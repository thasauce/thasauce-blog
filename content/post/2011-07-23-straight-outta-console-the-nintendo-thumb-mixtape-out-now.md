Bursting right out of the Sunshine State, the self-proclaimed record nerd and philosopher [For Beatâ€™s Sake](http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=401552) has just [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/forbeatssake/status/89524798178328577) about a brand new mixtape featuring some up-and-coming talents like Heath McNease, Davey Rockit, Playdough, Manchild, Red Cloud, and various artists. Although a tenderfoot to the VGM scene, this talented dude mixes in his own crude style with Nintendo samples to create an exquisitely real sound that leaves you wanting more.Â  For Beatâ€™s Sakeâ€™s work on _Straight Outta Console: The Nintendo Thumb Mixtap_e is no exception, as this particular release demonstrates his own proficiency as an artist to bring beats to the next level.

Check out _[Straight Outta Console: The Nintendo Thumb Mixtape](http://heathmcnease.bandcamp.com/)_ today, available now on Bandcamp.
