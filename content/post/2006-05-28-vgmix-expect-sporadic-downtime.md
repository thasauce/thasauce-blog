&#8220;Hi VGMixers,

Just a heads-up:  
If we&#8217;re up and down in the next few days/weeks/months occasionally, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; we&#8217;re frequently messing with webserver configuration, tweaking database parts, and the like. This might, for example, break the forum temporarily, or you could get 404s or DNS errors if someone screws up a config file. Sorry in advance, and don&#8217;t panic!
  
At the very least, the new server machine is fast, stable, and is managed by really good datacenter staff. So extended downtime or &#8220;disaster scenarios&#8221; will be less of a threat.

Of course, if the server is down, you won&#8217;t even be able to read this! Ha-ha! Internet!&#8221;
