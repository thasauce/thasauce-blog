Our good friend and composer extraordinaire Jake &#8220;virt&#8221; Kaufman has recently released his long atincipated FX3 on 8bitpeoples.com.

For those who don&#8217;t know, virt is an **extreme** chiptune
  
enthusiast, having already released two releases on monotonik called FX
  
and FX2, which were his first two releases of original chiptune music.
  
FX3 is beyond awesome. You **HAVE** to download it and listen for yourself&#8230; otherwise the world will end and all of your childhood dreams will fade.

Moment of Truth: the 3:45 mark of Survivors, Jake phrases a famous song by a very famous left handed guitarist.
