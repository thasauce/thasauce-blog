> I&#8217;m really trying to stop rambling on about [Nerdapalooza](http://www.nerdapaloozafest.com/), as I understand that it&#8217;s sort of asinine for me to do so. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t even there!

    Still, I think this is just a little too interesting not to pass along. It&#8217;s an event recap by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/coreyclarkmedia">Corey Clark</a> that my boy <a href="http://twitter.com/scrubclub/status/2882589107">MadHatter</a> turned me on to.

    It features music by Schaffer the Darklord, performance clips from The Grammar Club, The Megas, MCs Frontalot and Lars, and some great interview snippets with the fans, performers and organizers. Give it a look-see. Then be sure to rate, comment and/or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_0fpzrq5Vk&#038;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fcoreyclarkmedia&#038;feature=player_profilepage">pass it on</a>.
