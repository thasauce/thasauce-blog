excerpt: 'OverClocked ReMix has just released their thirty-second official arrangement
  album in tribute to the unsung heroes of role-playing games throughout the years,
  many of which have great merit but have received less musical attention than bigger
  names and franchises. Appropriately titled <i>Unsung Heroes</i>, the album features
  many overlooked titles such as <i>The 7th Saga</i>, <i>Ghouls''n Ghosts</i>, <i>The
  Lord of the Rings: Volume 1</i>, <i>Suikoden</i>, and <i>Persona 3</i>.'

Yesterday, [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) released their [thirty-second official arrangement album](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?p=838486#838486) in tribute toÂ the unsung heroes of role-playing games throughout the years, many of which have great merit but have received less musical attention than bigger names and franchises. Appropriately titled _Unsung Heroes_, the album features many overlooked titles such as _The 7th Saga,Â _Ghouls&#8217;n Ghosts,Â _The Lord of the Rings: Volume 1, Suikoden,___ and__ _Persona 3.___Â _Unsung Heroes_ also showcases the talents of prominent artists who have been consistently featured on both OCRemix and ThaSauce, from the likes ofÂ [DragonAvenger](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/dragonavenger/), [OA](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/oa/), [Rexy](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/rexy/), [Brandon Strader](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/brandon-strader/), [Avaris](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/avaris/), [Scaredsim](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/scaredsim/),Â [Nutritious](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/nutritious/)Â and much more.

DirectorÂ Andrew &#8220;OA&#8221; Luers had much to say on the underrepresented themes that permeated much of the titles touched upon in _Unsung Heroes:_

> We both agreed that while it is great to work with many well-known and often mixed themes &#8211; which are so loved for good reason &#8211; there should be no reason not to extend our hands into those games that have been overlooked for so long, but have genuinely beautiful themes as well. I&#8217;m proud of the work that these gentlemen and ladies have presented in this album, and hope that others will be able to appreciate the beauty of these tracks as well.

While you can get a small preview of the album above,Â _Unsung Heroes_Â is available for free download atÂ <a href="http://unsung.ocremix.org/" target="_blank"><strong>http://unsung.ocremix.org</strong></a>.
