White Bird is an album that I&#8217;ve been working on for a little over 2 months. It&#8217;s been slow-going because of how busy I&#8217;ve been at home and at work, but it&#8217;s finally done. At 58 minutes and 42 seconds, it&#8217;s a near-full-length album, though it only has 10 tracks (2 bonus included).

        This album contains 2 older songs that I decided mid-way to include: <em>Falling Stars</em>, and <em>Dreams We Forget</em>. This album also contains 2 &#8220;bonus&#8221; tracks, <em>Sleeping Giants</em> and <em>Distant Lands</em>, which are not publicly available for download, and may only be found in the album download.

        This<br /> album is comprised of mostly piano solo music with some contemporary<br /> jazz and light string sections sprinkled throughout. The songs range<br /> from chill out lounge music to soft, easy-listening piano, and include<br /> both newer and older piano pieces.

        The inspiration behind this<br /> album was, of course, the journey of a small white bird. However, what<br /> many people may not have caught was that it wasn&#8217;t literally about this<br /> white bird, though a lot of the inspiration came from the idea. The<br /> white bird is symbolic for any given person who starts out small on a<br /> journey through this large world. This album is about the experiences<br /> that person has, from nervously but bravely starting their journey, to<br /> meeting new friends, to seeing new and wonderful things, to arriving<br /> back home.
