I&#8217;m glad to announce that Suzu was about to fix my all-time favorite features on the site: the <a href="modules.php?name=Multiheadlines" target="_blank">Multi-headlines module</a>!
  
For those of you unfamiliar with the Multi-headlines module (as it&#8217;s been broke for awhile now), it&#8217;s a single massive RSS feed comprised of multiple RSS feeds from stuff that would be generally interesting to people in the community. Gaming news, music news, artist updates, webcomics, podcasts, WE GOT IT ALL.

You can subscribe to the <a href="rss.php?module=Multiheadlines" target="_blank">whole feed via RSS</a>.
