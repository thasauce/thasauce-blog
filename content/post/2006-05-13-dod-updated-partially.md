The <a href="http://dod.vgmix.com/" target="_self">Dwelling of Duels</a> website (which has monthly live instrumentation remix competitions) has updated their website with April&#8217;s submissions (American Adventure Game Month) to download. March 2006&#8217;s Metal Gear Month submissions still need to be added to downloaded and to be judged. I&#8217;ll keep you posted as to when they get added.
