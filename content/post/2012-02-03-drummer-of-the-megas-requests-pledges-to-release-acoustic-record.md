Mike Levinson, drummer of [The Megas](http://www.themegas.com/main/main.html) and former popular punk band Agent 51, has [recently launched a Kickstarter project](https://www.facebook.com/themegas/posts/103112486481999) to help him release an acoustic album:

> I&#8217;ve wanted to release an acoustic record for a long time, but I&#8217;ve never had the time, funding, or drive to make it happen. Now is the time. Playing drums comes naturally to me. I enjoy being the backbone of the band and its fitting of my personality that I get to hide behind my drums while the other guys do their thing in front of the crowd. While the spotlight generally isn&#8217;t my thing I still enjoy writing and creating my own songs. I&#8217;m very proud of the work I&#8217;ve done on drums, but I&#8217;d also like to release a piece of music that is undeniably a piece of who I am as a person and an artist. This album I&#8217;d like to record is the Michael Hell acoustic album which I&#8217;m planning on titling &#8220;A Tell Tale Heart&#8221; in a nod to my favorite author and fellow troubled soul Edgar Allen Poe.

While we know that this album is not directly correlated to VGM news, we&#8217;d like to help support Mike Levinson as a very talented artist who has boldly put himself out there. The incentives are also a bonus for you Megas fans out there: a $50+ pledge gets you a signed drumstick used by Mr. Levinson at a Megas show, aÂ copy of the extremely rare Megas Comic-Con sampler from 2007 with some early mixes pre-_Get Equipped,_ and aÂ DLN01 &#8220;Demo Get&#8221; CD with demos from the band&#8217;s inception.

You can find more information on Mr. Levinson&#8217;s project and pledge incentives on [his Kickstarter project page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/685828037/the-michael-hell-acoustic-record-drummer-of-the-me).
