This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/): As Thanksgiving draws nigh, Rayza and Pixietricks take a moment to celebrate the feast we all know as OCR. NES covers, remixing compos, \*two\* Rusian Remix Roulettes, and foreign poetry from afar&#8211; get ready for this fat-tastic show!
