</center>If you don&#8217;t know what 

[PAX East](http://east.paxsite.com/index.php) is, you&#8217;ve either been living under a rock or well&#8230; living under a rock.Â Taking place in Boston, Massachusetts on April 6th, 2012,Â PAX East is the ultimate three-day game festival for tabletop, videogame, and PC gamers alike. In addition toÂ nerdcore concerts, panel discussions, and an exhibitor hall filled with booths displaying the latest from top game publishers and developers, the best part of PAX East is partying with like-minded individuals who probably like gaming as much as the next guy.

So, what are you waiting for? Although three-day passes have been sold out for awhile, one-day passes are [still available](http://east.paxsite.com/registration.php) for $35 dollars.Â The concert line-up for PAX East has recently been finalized (which you can view below) and it&#8217;s looking very sexy.
