<div class="quoted-text">
  Just in time for Christmas, it’s the full version of <strong>8-Bit Jesus: Classic Christmas Songs in the Style of Classic NES Games</strong>. This<br /> full release contains 18 tracks total, including improved variations<br /> of a few of the original nine! Please be sure to check out the new <em>amazing</em> cover art for the full release, designed by <a title="Jude Buffum" href="http://www.judebuffum.com/home.html" target="_blank">Jude Buffum</a>.

    To download the album for <strong>free</strong>, click the<br /> appropriate link below. The download is available in both ZIP and RAR<br /> formats, or you can download individual tracks if you wish. To listen<br /> to a few of the tracks, please visit <a title="Doctor Octoroc's Myspace" href="http://www.myspace.com/octoroc" target="_blank">my Myspace page</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you really like the album, please consider donating any amount<br /> you wish via PayPal. If you don’t have PayPal and still wish to make a<br /> donation, money orders are more than welcome. Just <a title="eMail Doctor Octoroc at Yahoo" href="mailto:jazzlevi@yahoo.com">shoot me an email</a> to get my mailing address.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyone who donates $15 or more will receive a physical copy of <strong>8-Bit Jesus</strong> in the mail (see picture above for package, designed by <a title="Jude Buffum" href="http://www.judebuffum.com/" target="_blank">Jude Buffum</a>). If<br /> you donate $30, you will receive two, and so on. These include first<br /> class shipping, so don’t worry about that. If you live outside the<br /> U.S., please be prepared to wait a few weeks from the shipping<br /> date to receive your copy. I will be mailing these out in the order I<br /> receive the donations, but obviously, International shipping takes<br /> longer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Due to the insanity of the holiday season, I will likely not be able<br /> to mail the copies out until after Christmas, but that all depends on<br /> how many I have to send. Many, I would hope! If your PayPal address is<br /> different from the address to which you want the copy mailed, make sure<br /> you include the correct mailing address in a note along with your<br /> payment, or in an email after you make your payment (be sure to include<br /> your PayPal confirmation number, or PayPal e-mail address, if different<br /> from the email from which you send the address information). Click the<br /> “Contact Doctor Octoroc” button at the right side of the top menu to<br /> send me a message, or just send an email to <strong>jazzlevi[at]yahoo[dot]com</strong>. For anyone who forgets to send their address, I will send a message to get this information when I get to your order. Please be patient, as I am producing, packaging, and mailing these myself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>EDIT 01: I’ve decided, due to the number of donations I’ve<br /> gotten so far, to send these to a professional cd duplication/printing<br /> place. The advantage is, you get an even better looking physical copy!<br /> The disadvantage is, you might have to wait til mid January or even<br /> beginning of February to get it. Trust me, it will be worth the wait!<br /> You’ve seen the artwork above, right? Imagine that times six, and<br /> that’s the finished package deal! Actually…multiply it by seven,<br /> counting the disc.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>EDIT 02: You may have trouble downloading the file(s) due to<br /> massive downloads (that’s what I get for offering this for free,<br /> haha), so please visit one of the following links to download a mirror<br /> if you expereinced problems coming to the site!</strong>
