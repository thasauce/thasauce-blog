From <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=67695" target="_self">Gray&#8217;s post on OCR:<br /></a>  
<span class="postbody">I&#8217;ve been getting bombarded with PMs and whatnot from you guys about this, so I guess now is the proper time for this.</p> 

<p>
  The panel has in recent months adopted a policy where judges must meet<br /> certain activity requirements in order to remain in the panel. The<br /> policy is paying off, as we are in striking distance, for the first<br /> time in over 3 years to reduce the queue backlog entirely. We are on<br /> the brink of reducing the submission queue to the range of 2 weeks<br /> -> live.</span><br /> <span class="postbody"><br /> Ultimately, Zyko has other priorities that need attention and due to<br /> this is no longer able to continue his position in the panel, at least<br /> in the short term. In his almost 11 month term, he has brought new<br /> perspectives and ways of thinking to the panel. Viewing this as both a<br /> friend and as colleague, it is a great loss. The panel and myself would<br /> like to wish him the best of luck and give our sincere thanks for his<br /> help through these many months. If circumstances permit, and he finds<br /> more time in the future to contribute he&#8217;s more than welcome to rejoin.<br /></span>
