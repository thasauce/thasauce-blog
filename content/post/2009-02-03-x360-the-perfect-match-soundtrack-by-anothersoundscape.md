    <strong>The Perfect Match</strong><strong> &#8211; 400MSPoints &#8211; with original soundtrack by Another Soundscape!<br /> <a href="http://soundscape.escariot.net/The%20Perfect%20Match%20Official%20Soundtrack.zip" target="_blank">Soundtrack avaliable for FREE!</a></strong>

    Yup, I scored another game soundtrack and I&#8217;m quite proud of this one!<br /> The second Community Game I scored (the first being the best-selling <a href="http://www.okgamescompany.com/" target="_blank">Artoon</a>)<br /> is a gameshow/dating simulator called The Perfect Match. If I<br /> understand it correctly (and I&#8217;m pretty sure I do) you take the role of<br /> the host of this &#8220;game show&#8221; and try to find the contestants perfect<br /> match. You can check it out at the <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025855016f/" target="_blank">Xbox.com page</a> and pretty soon also the developer&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.okgamescompany.com/" target="_blank">OKGamesCompany.com.</a> If you feel like you want to try it out, there is a <strong>demo</strong> avaliable on Xbox Live Marketplace that you can download both directly from your 360 and via your computer.

  I always try my best to release the soundtrack for free and managed to do so with this game too. It can be <strong><a href="http://soundscape.escariot.net/The%20Perfect%20Match%20Official%20Soundtrack.zip" target="_blank">downloaded for free</a></strong><br /> as a .zip file with 320kbps MP3s from my webspace (thanks escariot!)<br /> until it&#8217;s uploaded at Onion Factory&#8217;s official site, I will then<br /> update the url. See it as a gift for the VGM-community!All tracks were made entirely in Reason 4 and set out to portray the<br /> games visual style and gameshow-concept. It&#8217;s bouncy, cute and quite<br /> catchy if I may say so myself. If you like it, feel free to share it<br /> with anyone or perhaps (where applicable) make a remix? I&#8217;d love to<br /> hear what you come up with!</p>

    <strong>Raves and reviews:</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.beefjack.com/blog/news/360/xbox-live-community-games-new-releases-180109/" target="_blank">BeefJack.com</a> &#8211; The Perfect Match, which I thought was a highly polished product that looked and sounded better than some XBLA games
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So the bottom line here is: if you&#8217;re interested, feel free to download<br /> the soundtrack and give the game a try. It would mean a lot to me and<br /> might turn out to be quite an enjoyable experience for you too ;P
