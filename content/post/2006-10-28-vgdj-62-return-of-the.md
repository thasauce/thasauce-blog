This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):

Uh oh, pixietricks is missing! What is a zircon to do? Why, call upon
  
an old friend that longtime listeners of our show should remember;
  
Fusion2004! If you&#8217;re not familiar, he runs his own radio show about
  
video game music and is the main coder for ThaSauce (which in and of
  
itself is about video games and VGM). We figured he&#8217;d make a fine guest
  
host while our dear pixietricks attends to all matters Peabodian. So,
  
ladies, enjoy this male-only foray into the wonderful world of OCR
  
while you can! And if two male hosts aren&#8217;t enough, all three (male)
  
minihosts are back on board too ðŸ˜‰ Mmm.. testosterone.
