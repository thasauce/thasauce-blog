At MAGFest, I finally figured out why virt&#8217;s music site wasn&#8217;t being updated anymore: <a href="http://www.biglionmusic.com/" target="_blank">He has a new one</a> (and <a href="http://www.biglionmusic.com/feed" target="_blank">it has a news feed</a>, thank goodness). So when I got home I added it to my <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/sgtrama" target="_blank">Super Seekrit Netvibes Universe</a>* that I use for covering the community, and it didn&#8217;t take long to deliver. virt has already uploaded 2 new songs for download.

*_I&#8217;m gonna be releasing a PROPER ThaSauce Netvibes Universe sometime soon for public use&#8230;feel free to use mine until then, but know a newer, BETTER one will be out shortly, and linked somewhere on the main page._

    This is one of the three new songs I debuted at MAGFest 7 &#8211;<br /> An FM journey into an epic past where metallic wizards do battle on<br /> high windy cliffs with guitars and lightning. Dedicated to Wizwars, who<br /> couldn’t be at Magfest, and who was deeply missed in an otherwise<br /> incredible chiptune concert.

    This is Nugget’s Theme. For anyone who doesn’t already know,<br /> Nugget is my adorable puppy (there’s a link to a picture on my About<br /> page). This song is for and about him — his own simpler, more upbeat<br /> counterpart to “Staring at My Spaceship”. The mini-melodies during the<br /> silent pauses are the “fanfares” our Roomba vacuum plays when it starts<br /> and finishes cleaning, respectively. The Roomba is Nugget’s best<br /> friend, they were raised together.
