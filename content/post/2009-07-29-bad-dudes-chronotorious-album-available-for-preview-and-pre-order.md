> Watch out! The [Bad Dudes](http://baddudesmusic.com/) are back! And badder than ever! No that&#8217;s ridiculous, they are already the baddest dudes. Anyway, they have very recently announced that their upcoming tribute to the amazing classic Chrono Trigger, awesomely titles [Chronotorious is available for pre-order](http://baddudesmusic.com/preorder.html).

> Not only that, but if you click on &#8220;albums/eps&#8221; and then click on the Chronotorious album, then hit tracks, you can preview all the songs from the album! But you can only get five of those tracks on the official pressed album release. Danimal cannon of the Bad Dudes and <a href="http://myspace.com/armcannon" target="_self">Armcannon</a> fame personally describes these songs as &#8220;bad-fucking-ass&#8221; and you don&#8217;t argue with a bad dude who&#8217;s last name is Cannon.

>     <span class="Apple-style-span">Also if you pre-order the album now, the album will only cost you $10, this will rise to $12 come August 18th, not to mention that the album also comes with a sweet poster. Oh, and did I mention they are only making 1000 albums! So don&#8217;t drag your feet, I already pre-ordered my copy, so realistically there are only 999 left at most!</span>

So for any would be directors out there, you can try your hand at making a video for the Dhsu vs. Mustin &#8211; B.A.M.F. (Radio Edit) track. And for anyone else, you can just download the radio edit track and wait in anticipation of this sure to be amazing album!
