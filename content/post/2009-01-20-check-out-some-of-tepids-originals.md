  hey, I&#8217;ve been doing original electro music for a while and thought I<br /> might share some of it with you. Most of it is in progress, so bear<br /> with me while I continue to work on it. My influences are artists such<br /> as datA/Dimension/JUSTICE/Masashi Hamauzu&#8230;

    and here&#8217;s a little something I wrote today called <a href="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/14/2268053/Trix%20Pt.%20Duexv2.mp3" target="_blank"><strong>Trix Pt. Duex</strong></a>. This is because a sampled some synth chords from a Japanese fusion band called Trix.
