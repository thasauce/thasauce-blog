Fresh out of [Ubiktune](http://ubiktune.org/), classic tracker composer [Chris J. Hampton](http://www.chrisjh.com/) has just released a new album just in time for Valentine&#8217;s Day. AlsoÂ known by his alternate moniker **beek**, this 8-bit veteran has appeared in various Ubiktune releases such as _[Around Past](http://ubiktune.org/releases/ubi012-teleidofusion-around-past)_ and _[Wintertunes](http://ubiktune.org/releases/ubi013-various-artists-wintertunes)_ for a while now_._ beek&#8217;sÂ _7bit date: robot loveÂ _sacrilegiously pushes the chiptune genre over the edge, in a frenzied flurry of chip sounds that manages to make our ears happy. Marked by retro influences from the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, beek&#8217;s work is a total blast to the past, actively transporting the listener to a time when chiptunes were prioritized as primary sources of composition and arrangement.

Describing _7bit date: robot love_ as aÂ  &#8220;a varied collection of chippy goodness&#8221;, beek relates his own experiences with the album with special attention to resisting traditional chip sounds:

> _7bit date: robot love_Â is a collection of chips I began tracking in 2008, with one song reaching as far back as 1998. In 2008, having recently graduated from university, I reexamined my chiptune past and decided to get back in the game. Life carried on, and years later, I remembered my original goal of a new chipdisk release.. Here we are today, 2012!
> 
> ForÂ _7bit date_, I didn&#8217;t limit myself to traditional chip sounds. I make use of Amiga ST-XX samples in a few tracks â€” a process which rekindled some of my imagination, as I remembered this or that MOD from back in the day with each Amiga sample I came across. Another characteristic of my chips is to use no external/post-processing effects, just some occasional Schism filters, so the original .IT files will reproduce pretty close to the MP3.

While _7 bit date: robot love_ is available on [beek&#8217;s Bandcamp](http://b-e-e-k.bandcamp.com/album/7bit-date-robot-love), we&#8217;ve also included a few tracks to preview for you below. Go and get some chiptune lovin&#8217; today!
