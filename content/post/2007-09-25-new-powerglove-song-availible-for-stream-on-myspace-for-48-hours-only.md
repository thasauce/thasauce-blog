Powerglove has put a new song on their MySpace music player from their upcoming album &#8220;Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man&#8221;, but only for 48 hours.

GO LISTEN TO IT, IT&#8217;S <3 From <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vgmetal" target="_blank">MySpace</a>:

 _By order of the Metatron (Alan Rickman), the first
  
track from Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man, entitled &#8220;So Sexy
  
Robotnik,&#8221; has been posted.</p> 

Sonic 2 is the game of choice.

But there is only enough power to sustain speed metal and saxophone soloing for 48 hours, so now is the time for ACTION!!!!</em>
  
_Do not live a life of regrets! What will you tell your
  
grandchildren? That you let opportunity slip through your bony fingers,
  
or that you went to our myspace page and listened??? No one can choose
  
for you.</p> 

Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?

Thus, logically, you must listen to our new song.

QED
