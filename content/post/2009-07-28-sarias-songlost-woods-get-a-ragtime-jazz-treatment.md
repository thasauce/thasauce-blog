I happened to come across this video through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zeldauniverse.net/">Zelda Universe</a>. This is (what I think) a fantastic version of Lost Woods/Saria&#8217;s Song from the _Ocarina of Time_. For the musically minded the video also contains what bars are being played, which is a nice addition for those concerned. If you have fond memories of OoT please have a look at this, it sounds fantastic and you won&#8217;t regret it.

In the last few days the writer of these has done a few versions of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CgjLsnTRZE&#038;">Song of Storms</a> which are very much worth a look as well.
