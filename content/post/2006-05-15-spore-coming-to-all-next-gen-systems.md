When Nintendo initially announced that Wii would be the &#8220;system that never sleeps&#8221; and that it&#8217;d always be online, I made a comment over on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamesarefun.com">GamesAreFun</a> about how that would be _perfect_ for Spore. I had no idea they&#8217;d actually RELEASE Spore on the Wii, though!

A recent interview with Will Wright about his upcoming PC game [_Spore_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Spore)
  
revealed his intentions of porting it to all next-generation systems as
  
well as cell phones. These conversions will be released some time after
  
the debut of the PC version.

_Spore_ is set for a release date of first quarter of 2007.
