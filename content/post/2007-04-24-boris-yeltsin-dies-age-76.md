The esteemed former president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, has passed on earlier today. He was an ally of the United States during his tenure, and though his health suffered after quintuple bypass surgery in 1996 he was instrumental in making sweeping changes to the former Soviet state&#8230; although his successor has recently been reigning in capitolism in favour of stalin-like politics.

So have a shot of vodka and remember one of the greatest. (no. wrong. i&#8217;m a poser.)
