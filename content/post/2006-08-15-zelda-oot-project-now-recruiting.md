    This particular project is the brainchild of Nario, <span class="byuser">Link12584, and Jewbei, and so far there has been <a href="http://www.vgmix.com/vg25/viewtopic.php?id=2497" target="_blank">a VGMix thread informing us that they are now recruiting.</a><br /> In this thread there are also some good points made about the scene in general<br /> [depending on who you agree with, I guess]. As of this news post, the<br /> artists who have signed on include myself, DistantJ, Strike911, DJ<br /> Siamey, and a few others that I don&#8217;t know very well yet.</span></p>

      <span class="byuser">I&#8217;m encouraging that you get in contact with Nario, Link12584 or Jewbei and sign up for a track! I think this&#8217;ll be a great learning experience for everyone involved.</p>
