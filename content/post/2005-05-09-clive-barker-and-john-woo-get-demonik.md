#### Acclaimed filmmakers announce they are simultaneously producing a
  
next-gen console game and film. First screens and trailer inside.

(Horror gaming news is important to me)

Acclaimed action director John Woo has long expressed his interest in
  
video games&#8211;and he&#8217;s shown it by scooping up the film rights to
  
Metroid and helming the film adaptation of Spy Hunter, starring Dwayne
  
&#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson.

Now, Woo&#8217;s game company, Tiger Hill Entertainment, is further blurring
  
the line between film and games. Today, Majesco announced it will
  
publish Demonik, a new horror-action game co-published by Tiger Hill
  
and written by writer/director/author Clive Barker. The game marks the
  
latest project for _Hellraiser_ director Barker, who also oversaw development of Undying, the acclaimed 2001 action game from Electronic Arts. 

Developed by Terminal Reality, the studio behind the BloodRayne
  
games&#8211;which are themselves being made into films&#8211;Demonik is scheduled
  
to ship in 2006 for unspecified &#8220;next-generation consoles.&#8221;It will also
  
be simultaneously developed as a film property. &#8220;Barker is set to
  
oversee the story, character designs, cinematics and voice talent for
  
the game,&#8221; according to Majesco. &#8220;Barker also has the option to write
  
and direct the film.&#8221;

&#8220;Demonik will be an intense gaming experience,&#8221; said Barker in
  
a statement. &#8220;I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun enriching the game&rsquo;s mythology
  
and polishing the characters till they shine. And, of course, adding a
  
little bit of Barker darkness. Demonik promises to be a game that you
  
will play with clammy palms.&#8221;

Besides hand-sweat predictions, Majesco was rather mum on
  
details about Demonik, saying only that it is a &#8221; third-person action
  
game that allows players to control the ultimate bad guy&#8211;wreaking
  
havoc with a variety of innovative and spectacular powers and
  
abilities.&#8221; 

GameSpot will have more on Demonik as further details are made available.
