Worst title ever, I know, but seriously worth a read ðŸ˜®

From the <a href="http://blog.capcom.com/archives/1020" target="_blank">Capcom Community Blog</a>:

    As you probably already know, our recent Capcom Digital Day event<br /> was a media event. Meaning, the invites were extended only to gaming<br /> press and media folks, as opposed to the general public. What you<br /> probably didn&rsquo;t know was that we actually extended a few &ldquo;community&rdquo;<br /> invites to the Capcom community: Loyal Capcom community fans who<br /> happened to be located around the San Francisco area.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I followed two of them, Tony and Alex, around for most of the event,<br /> getting their informal impressions on what they saw and taking pictures<br /> of the whole thing. At the end of which held a <strong>special surprise</strong> for them!

        Alex is your normal average Street<br /> Fighter fanatic, except for one thing: He was actually contracted to do<br /> a few music tracks on the upcoming SSFIITHDR. Because of this, getting<br /> to see SSFIITHDR was especially satisfying to him (He hadn&rsquo;t actually<br /> seen it even though he did some tracks for it), and the bulk of his<br /> visit was spent on the SF Kiosks. He&rsquo;s no fluke too, and handed out<br /> plenty of butt-kicking to all challengers. As a gamer, he was no fluke<br /> as well, as he set the record for the lowest time in the Bionic<br /> Commando Rearmed Challenge Room challenge that we had laid down to<br /> everyone present, besting all the gaming &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; (To bad his<br /> score didn&rsquo;t count, as he set the record on his second, unofficial, go<br /> around).

        Intrepid web programmer by day, closet gamer by night, Tony was<br /> another community member we invited who was also a Street Fighter<br /> fanatic. So much so, he was especially stoked that he got to meet Seth.<br /> A well rounded gamer, Tony tried his hand at all the playable titles on<br /> the floor, after which he assured me he would definitely be buying a<br /> few of them given how awesome they were, with SSFIITHDR and BCR at top<br /> of his purchase list.

        After the event ended, came the special surprise we had for them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Although it wasn&rsquo;t on the itinerary, as the event winded down, I<br /> escorted them to the elevator and snuck them upstairs. They thought I<br /> was going to silence them permanently and then dump their body where it<br /> wouldn&rsquo;t be found since they had just seen all these then-secretive<br /> announcements.
      </p>

        I was actually taking them to a conference room called Street Fighter. Inside of which held two arcade cabinets, which housed <em>Street Fighter IV</em>.

        The two of them got about 30 minutes of alone time with Street<br /> Fighter IV. GDC notwithstanding, I think Tony and Alex are among the<br /> first in the &ldquo;general public&rdquo; to have gotten to play Street Fighter IV.<br /> Up until the event, they had only seen screenshots, which they both<br /> noted don&rsquo;t do the game justice. The game has to be seen in motion,<br /> with your own eyes, to be believed.

        It was interesting to note that the first characters chosen was Ken<br /> and Guile, even though they did eventually ran through the gamut of<br /> characters, including Abel and Crimson Viper (Both of which they<br /> thought was very cool).

        In the end, I had to rip their bloody hands away from the controls.<br /> For the record, Alex whooped on Tony pretty badly, no matter what<br /> characters were chosen. In fact, Alex had to lose on purpose so that he<br /> can check out some of the other characters.

        So&hellip; the moral of this story? Keep an eye out on our community sites<br /> (blog, forums) for news of the next event, because you never know when<br /> we&rsquo;ll be extending more invites. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll even be willing to fly<br /> some of you out here too&hellip;
