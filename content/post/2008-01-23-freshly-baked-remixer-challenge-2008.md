[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?p=368809">Originally posted on OCReMix</a>]  
Way back in 2002 a forum user, who&#8217;s name escape me
  
today (sorry if you&#8217;re still out there D:) ran a 1-shot competition
  
called the Freshly Baked ReMixer challenge. In the thread artist signed
  
up and were assigned challenges posted by other forum users. This is
  
how artists like myself, Suzumebachi, and GLL all got out starts. There
  
were also some other impressive tracks by Disco Dan and a few others.
  
Some time later the same user did the Second Annual FBRC which, while
  
not as popular as the first one, still saw some solid success. 

Since the competition has long been forgotten by most, and seeing all
  
the talent that&#8217;s on OCReMix today, I think it&#8217;s time we try a revival.  
<u>  
The Premise:</u>
  
As stated above the idea of the competition is for forum
  
users to challenge remixers to remixes of songs/games they request. The
  
remixer than has a predetermined amount of time to produce a remix of
  
said material.

<u>The Plan:</u>
  
Previously everyone just winged it, and sometimes it
  
worked, sometimes it didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been tossing around in my head a new
  
system that should make the situation better for everyone&#8230;

Mixers:
  
Phase 1 will be mixer sign-up. It will last until next
  
Saturday, and ANYONE wishing to enter may. Be it an established artist
  
or not. Any and all are welcome, and encouraged to enter. 

The Challenges:
  
Following Phase 1, there will be a 1 week period where
  
any forum user can submit challenges. Be it from a game, or a specific
  
song. Challengers MUST include a source tune for reference and **ALL CHALLENGERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO NOT PICK SONGS THAT&#8217;RE TOO OBSCURE** .
  
This is merely a suggestion as the easier it is for a remixer to get a
  
midi, or familiarity with a song, the more likely the finished project
  
will be a quality piece of work. During Phase 2 each user is only
  
allowed 1 challenge. ReMixers already in the challenge are allowed to
  
issue challenges themselves.

The Match-Ups:
  
Once we populate a list of mixers and challenges, a
  
script be create and will distribute the songs to each mixer. There
  
will a few days grace period while we sort everything out, and
  
following that **mixers will have 1 month** to finish their
  
challenge. In the event that there are more challenges than mixers
  
(which is likely) if a mixer successfully finishes their channel
  
(COMPLETELY a QUALITY remix) then they are free to once again randomly
  
select another song from the pool. The only stipulation is remixers CAN
  
NOT be selected to remix a song THEY requested as a challenge.

Winning:
  
**There will be **NO** voting.**
  
This contest is specifically for remixers to test their abilities as a
  
mixer, and to give users a chance to get their favorite under-remixed
  
song finally mixed. Everyone who completes a quality product is a
  
winner, and every listener wins as well.

<u>Current Status:</u>

  * Phase 1: Wednesday, January 22nd &#8211; Saturday, Febuary 2nd, 23:59PM EST
  * Phase 2: Sunday, Febuary 3rd &#8211; Saturday, Febuary 9nd, 23:59PM EST
  * Phase 3: TBD

PLEASE NOTE: Mixer sign-ups AND song requests WILL BOTH BE HANDED IN <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?p=368809">THIS THREAD</a>.
