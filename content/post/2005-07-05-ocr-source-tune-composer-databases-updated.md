After completing updates for all of the <a target="_self" href="http://www.ocremix.org/list.php?type=remixers&#038;sort=mixerasc">ReMixer profiles</a> at the top of this year, OC ReMix now has updated <a target="_self" href="http://www.ocremix.org/list.php?type=composers&#038;sort=composerasc">composer information</a> for all of the games represented on the site, as well as information on which <a target="_self" href="http://www.ocremix.org/list.php?type=songs&#038;sort=gameasc">original VGM source tunes</a>
  
have been arranged. These updates will hopefully lead to more
  
appreciation and acknowledgement for original game music and the many
  
composers whose works have inspired the game arrangement community.
