[Chip Music Chronicle](http://www.youtube.com/user/kozue255?feature=mhum) has tickled our senses recently by recording and posting tons of live performances on YouTube for those who missed this year&#8217;s PAX EAST. Along with their fastidious documentation of chip music sets shot on location from all over the East Coast, Chip Music Chronicle seems dedicated to bring usÂ great audio and video quality of the shows that we simply cannot attend. For that, we express gratitude towards founder and Â curator Emily K. Feder for making these viewings possible!

This week&#8217;s _Quick Look_ highlightsÂ Protomen&#8217;s &#8220;The Hounds&#8221; from Act II, featuring the established &#8220;guerilla-style&#8221; recording that CMC has specifically chosen to echo an exclusive, in-person performance. With this being said, The Protomen absolutely kill it with their staggering on-stage presence, allowing for a exhilarating view at each band member while the audience excitedly rages on. Peep and click the video above to be directed to an entire Protomen playlist, live from PAX EAST 2012.
