The <a href="http://www.magfest.org" target="_blank">MAGFest website</a> has recently been updated with the new M5 logo, theme, and with a (seemingly) official date and location for MAGFest 5.
  
Next years MAGFest will be held in Vienna, VA on Thursday, January 4th through Sunday, January 7th. I know I&#8217;m gonna try like hell to get there, and as always I advise that anyone else who even thinks they might be able to, try try tryyyy. You won&#8217;t regret it.
