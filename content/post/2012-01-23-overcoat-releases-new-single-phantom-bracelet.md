[Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/)Â late-nightÂ DJ extraordinaire and remixer [Scott &#8220;OverCoat&#8221; Porter](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/overcoat/)Â has just released a new single entitled &#8220;Phantom Bracelet&#8221;:

> Just finished a new tune. I called it &#8220;Phantom Bracelet&#8221; in honor of the 21 and over wristband I had to wear for the entirety of MAGFest X. It still feels like it&#8217;s there as I type this. You canÂ [download the song here](http://soundtempest.net/soc/single/oc-phantombracelet.mp3), or find it in the /single/ folder. MAGFest was awesome, as usual.

We don&#8217;t normally do a write-up for singles, but we have to say that &#8220;Phantom Bracelet&#8221;&#8216;s synthpop wobbles get us going _a little **too** much._ Shown with the kind ofÂ quality that this song delivers, we definitely hope that this is a sign of good things to come from OverCoat. Be sure to tune in to his show Radio OverCoat on [Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/) every Wednesday from 10 PM &#8211; 12 AM EST. We guarantee that you won&#8217;t be disappointed.
