Jimmy, a staple of OverClocked ReMix, but most recently known for his work on the [Mass Effect 2 soundtrack](http://www.biggiantcircles.com/music/me2/), Â has released his [long awaited original album &#8220;Imposter Nostalgia&#8221;](http://ubiktune.org/releases/ubi028-big-giant-circles-impostor-nostalgia) which, at the time of writing this, is the #1 album on Bandcamp. The music is retro, 8-bit, indie inspired and includes other video game music community artists like [zircon](http://zirconmusic.com/) (OverClocked ReMix, Return All Robots), [Alexander Brandon](http://www.alexanderbrandon.net/) (Deus Ex, Unreal Tournament), and [C418](http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha) (Minecraft). The base price of the album is set at $3.99 and it&#8217;s well worth every penny of it.

### Bloodrayne:Â BetrayalÂ Original Soundtrack by Jake &#8220;virt&#8221; Kaufman

Next up is Jake &#8220;virt&#8221; Kaufman with the [original soundtrack to Bloodrayne: Betrayal](http://ubiktune.org/releases/ubi029-virt-bloodrayne-betrayal-official-soundtrack). If you like Castlevania style music with a lot of guitar shred, this album is for you. Additionally the album also includes an entire 8-bit version as well!

A proud, exhausted (per usual) sounding, Jake explains the story of how it came to be:

> &#8220;During development, the programmers were usingÂ _Nightwish_Â tracks andÂ _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_Â tracks as temp music. So, I said to them, &#8220;I can do better than that.. just kidding, I can&#8217;t actually, but I&#8217;ll do my best!&#8221; and cried softly to myself. After 3 months of writing, shredding, recording and mixing, I had finished our soundtrack. The guys in New Jersey (the publishers) said &#8220;Whoa, this is the real music from the game?&#8221; and we said &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; and they said &#8220;YEAHHH!!&#8221; and did jump-kicks.
> 
> Then, I came up with the completely idiotic idea to include an unlockable NES soundtrack, to replace the regular one. The director, Sean Velasco, yelled &#8220;DO IT!!&#8221; before I was even finished pitching the idea. The programmers said &#8220;that would kick ass!&#8221; and promptly forgot about it until the end of the project, whereupon they said &#8220;Sorry, no time left!&#8221; (there actually was no time left, they were already living at the office 24/7 and surviving on a diet of Moon Pies).
> 
> So I begged and pleaded and used my Jewish guilt powers; eventually the lead programmer said &#8220;Oh, all right&#8221; like that time Dad finally let you get a Cowboys-and-Indians BB gun. They wrote the functionality to enable &#8220;8 Fingers, 8 Bits&#8221; mode, as I frantically tried to learn FamiTracker and cover each song note-for-note. I imagine most working composers would just have run MIDI files through a &#8220;chiptune-o-matic&#8221; converter like GXSCC, rather than creating machine-code-compatible, authentic VRC6 versions. But most working composers probably don&#8217;t have a death wish, and actually value their time.
> 
> This album is dedicated toÂ _Pablo Bert_, a.k.a.Â _DJ Mike Haggar_Â &#8212; a truly amazing human being who, among other heroic feats, helped my wife avoid failing Calculus last semester. He was also in the Guinness Book of Records for his world-record Battletoads speedrun.
> 
> The NES portion (available in FTM source format for your amusement) is further dedicated to_jsr_, the creator of FamiTracker, who has worked very hard to make one the finest chiptune hobbyist tools in history.&#8221;Â â€” Jake Kaufman.

The Bloodrayne: Betrayal soundtrack, as well as it&#8217;s 8-bit counter part, have their base price set at an astonishing **$0**.

I thoroughly recommend that everyone go out and at least give the 2 albums a listen. If you&#8217;re not dropping at least $20 after listening to both of these, I suggest you make a doctor&#8217;s appointment to gear your ears checked immediately. This has truly been an early Christmas for any VGM enthusiast.
