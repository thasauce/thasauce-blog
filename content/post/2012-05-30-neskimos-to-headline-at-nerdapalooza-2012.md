Team Nerdapalooza [has just announced](http://nerdapalooza.org/2012/05/25/legends-rising/) that the famed VGM cover band [NESkimos](http://www.neskimos.com/) will headline at this year&#8217;s event in Orlando, FL from **August 3rd &#8211; 5th**:

> Nowâ€¦ you may have heard of this one band calledÂ <a href="http://www.neskimos.com/" rel="nofollow">the NESkimos</a>. They've played some shows you may have heard of likeÂ <a href="http://magfest.org/" rel="nofollow">MAGFest</a>Â Â andÂ <a href="http://paxsite.com/" rel="nofollow">PAX</a>. So yeah know, no big deal. Sadly, they've been MIA since 2006. They're from Florida so it's always been a goal of mine to get them back together somehow to play the event. OH WAIT. Guess who is coming back together and playing at Nerdapalooza? THAT'S RIGHT! We got the NESkimos as our latest Headliner! Pretty damn big news.

If you haven&#8217;t heard of the NESkimos, these dudes will rock your world with their [unique metal covers](http://soundcloud.com/neskimos/) which certainly adds to the allure of seeing them perform live this August after being inactive for over six years. While you can check out more of their epic arrangements on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neskimos&oq=neskimos&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&gs_l=youtube.3..0l10.21445.22143.0.22287.8.7.0.1.1.1.145.799.2j5.7.0...0.0.SvlJMjBlqL0), make sure to [purchase a Nerdapalooza ticket](http://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/122449/tfly) if you haven&#8217;t already.
