From [1up](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3160790):

<img border="0" align="right" src="http://h.xerol.org/i/facetraining2.png" alt="In your face" title="In your face" />_&#8220;If you thought the cook book software, eye training and common sense training were all bizarre, think again. Face Training DS is the latest release in the Touch Generation series from Nintendo.</p> 

The software will come with a stand for the DS and a Facening Scan camera that will display the player&#8217;s face on screen. Players will follow the text and voice instructions accordingly and proceed to flex those facial muscles.&#8221;</em>

Perhaps the most important part of this story is the DS camera, which opens up the platform to even more interactivity. The game ships August 2 in Japan, and has an official website [here](http://touch-ds.jp/mfs/kao_training/index.html).
