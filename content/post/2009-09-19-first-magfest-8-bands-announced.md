    <strong>Metroid Metal</strong>: Originally a solo project by Grant Henry, this excellent <a href="http://metroidmetal.com/" target="_blank">metal tribute to Nintendo&#8217;s Metroid series</a> became a live band and made its full-on debut at last year&#8217;s MAGFest. Currently playing at PAX 2009 in Seattle this weekend, they just released their new album <a href="http://vgmdb.net/album/13166" target="_blank">&#8220;Varia Suite&#8221;</a> and you can both become a Metroid Metal sponsor and <a href="http://www.metroidmetal.com/metroid-metal-varia-suite.html" target="_blank">get Varia Suite from the Metroid Metal site</a>. They&#8217;ll be returning this year to attach to your head and drain all your energy, so get your ice beam ready!

    <strong>Arm Cannon:</strong> An internationally renowned 5 piece band from Buffalo NY, these guys have definitely made their mark remixing video game classics. They skillfully reincarnate classic melodies of yore into a progressive-metal triumph of nostalgia. An Armcannon show will reawaken your inner child with the unmatchable power of rock. They&#8217;ve been wowing MAGFest attendees since our 5th year in 2007, and are glad to return this year. They also just released their <a href="http://vgmdb.net/album/13453" target="_blank">second CD</a>, so now you can <a href="http://armcannon.com/" target="_blank">purchase (and enjoy) Armcannon 2: The Return of the Attack of the Legend of Pizzor</a>.
