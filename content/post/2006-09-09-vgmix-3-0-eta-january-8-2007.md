&#8220;Wow.</strong>

<div align="justify">
  &#8220;The better part of a year has passed with<br /> no updates from us, just a lot of cheerleading. We&#8217;ve never attempted<br /> ANYTHING of this magnitude before. We have been silent about our ETA to<br /> avoid any disappointment or loss of credibility if we blew the target<br /> date. More like Duke VGMix Forever, right? This whole thing is<br /> incredibly difficult for a team of guys with full-time jobs and, for a<br /> few of us (not me), even social lives! </p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Excuses aside, <em>it&#8217;s INSANE that it&#8217;s taken this long</em>,<br /> and I apologize. I had hoped to relaunch mid-year at the latest, but it<br /> just didn&#8217;t happen &#8211; we have changed our approach a few times, written<br /> hundreds of pages of documentation, even switched programming languages<br /> and adopted a web framework so we wouldn&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel<br /> with databases and templating.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Our feature list has not<br /> changed, and our goals of security, speed, and expandability are<br /> finally being addressed. With our truly amazing programmers, I&#8217;m proud<br /> to say that we&#8217;re actually getting stuff done.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;So, here it is. Our ETA. <strong>January 8, 2007</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Seems like forever, but it&#8217;s only a few months. It&#8217;s the day after we return from <a target="_blank" href="http://magfest.org/">Magfest</a>.<br /> An ETA is of course an ESTIMATE, and with work and life how it is,<br /> anything could come up. But we deeply, truly believe in this site, and<br /> we&#8217;re not going to give up &#8211; no matter how long it takes. For the first<br /> time in my life I&#8217;m able to afford the server comfortably, so no<br /> donations are needed right now.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;We need sufficient time to work<br /> out the bugs in beta, which will be conducted with a small number of<br /> regulars &#8211; We need people we know personally who can thoroughly<br /> describe how stuff breaks, and who know the site backwards and forwards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Another,<br /> more unfortunate reason we withheld an ETA is the jerk factor. There<br /> are folks out there &#8211; the same who brought down 2.0 &#8211; who like to<br /> sabotage things just because they can, and then laugh about it.<br /> Launching unexpectedly would help rule out any planned disruptions. But<br /> honestly, if people want to break our stuff, they&#8217;ll probably break it.<br /> We&#8217;ll just do the best we can. With our new web host and vastly<br /> improved security, we can lock things down a lot better now, if it<br /> should come to that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;So hang in there. We&#8217;re coming back <strong>very, very soon</strong>!&#8221;<br />-virt</div>
