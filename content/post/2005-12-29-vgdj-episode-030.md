This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):
  
Merry Christmas, VGDJ listeners! (Yeah, let&#8217;s just pretend it still is,
  
kay?) Chrono Symphonic was postponed yet again, but have no fear; it
  
should be out before the New Year! OCR is bustling with holiday cheer,
  
with peer drawings, unmod Christmas cards, and the NYC meetup this
  
Friday the 30th! Enjoy your time off, and tune in next week for a
  
special New Year&#8217;s edition. Please feel free to call in with your
  
resolutions before then! ^_^
