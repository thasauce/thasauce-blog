Our very own **[zircon](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/zircon/)** has won &#8220;**Best Techno Album**,&#8221; and first AND third place in the &#8220;**Best Techno Song**&#8221; category of the **[2006 Just Plain Folk Music Awards](http://www.jpfolks.com/MusicAwards/)**!!!
  
If you haven&#8217;t heard &#8220;Tomorrow&#8221; and &#8220;Acid Dominion&#8221; off his original
  
album, Impulse Prime, better get your hands on &#8217;em.**
  
This is perhaps the
  
most well known and prestigious of the indie music awards, focusing on
  
the talent up and coming artists. (He even beat out the guy that
  
composed the music for Command & Conquer! Can I get a what what?)

**Congrats to yooooooouuuuuuuu!!!**
