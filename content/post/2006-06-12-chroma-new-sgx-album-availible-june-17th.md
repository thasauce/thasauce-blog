From [sgxmusic.com](http://sgxmusic.com/):  
**  
My new album _[Chroma](http://sgxmusic.com/chroma.htm)_ is totally droppin&#8217; JUNE 17.** 

It will be available both direct from me and from [cdbaby.com](http://www.cdbaby.com/) like [Better Than Sliced Beats](http://sgxmusic.com/btsb.htm) is. It will eventually show up on download services like iTunes, Napster, Yahoo, and others.
  
I haven&#8217;t decided yet on price. More info to come. There will be a bundle price from me for BTSB and Chroma together. 

Edit &#8211; I&#8217;ll be offering a coupon code for a small discount on Chroma
  
(if purchasing from me at my webstore) in my next mailinglist email on
  
the 17th. [Sign up!](http://sgxmusic.com/mailinglist.htm)
