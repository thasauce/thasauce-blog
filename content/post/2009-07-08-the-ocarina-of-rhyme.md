This is apparently kind of old, but I hadn&#8217;t heard of it until today. I came across this today when one friend of mine posted it on another friend&#8217;s Facebook wall. The album, as you could probably guess, is an collection of mash-ups of rap artists like Aesop Rock, Busta Rhymes, and MF DOOM with the soundtrack from Ocarina of Time.

You can <a href="http://teamteamwork.bandcamp.com/album/the-ocarina-of-rhyme" target="_blank">stream the whole album from here</a>, and you can also download the whole thing. When you click to download, you&#8217;re prompted to make an optional donation (you can choose to donate $0) to download higher quality files (320kbps CBR MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, etc., etc.) or download a free version for 128kbps CBR.

Finally you can <a href="http://teamteamwork.bandcamp.com/feed" target="_blank">subscribe to Team Teamwork&#8217;s RSS feed to get updates on future releases</a>.
