joins us to discuss a roundtable he held with four independent game
  
composers. This leads to an interesting conversation about music in
  
independent games. Also discussed is his monthly series of video
  
interviews with VGM artists. 

Also, a very special Win of the
  
Week for all you Valve fans and a preview of Otakon 2009 (or in other
  
words, I tell you how I plan to distribute the 2,000 business cards I
  
just ordered!).
