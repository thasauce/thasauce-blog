From zircon&#8217;s mailing list:

_&#8220;**[FF7 PROJECT RELEASE DATE]**
  
I&#8217;ve decided, after intensive research, to set the Final Fantasy 7 ReMix 
  
Project release date as September 7, 2007 &#8211; a little later than I had 
  
initially planned, but it seems to more accurately reflect when the game 
  
first came out in North America. We&#8217;re wrapping up the last of the 
  
tracks and getting the website together now. Keep your eyes peeled for it!&#8221;_
