Ubi-Soft, the company that resurrected the Prince of Persia franchise, has released a playable demo of the new Ninja Turtles game for download. In the demo, players are allowed to perform acrobatic stunts on the rooftops of New York City, beat up baddies, and learn new co-op maneuvers to aide in the pursuit of the evil that lurks in the shadows.
  
The video game will be released for retail sales March 20th, a mere three days before a brand new CGI TMNT movie is slated to be released.
