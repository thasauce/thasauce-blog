DarkeSword has started up a new remixing contest at OCR entitled the
  
Robot Master Remix Battle. A spinoff of the 6th IronMix
  
competition (now discontinued), the premise involves combining two Mega Man robot
  
master/Maverick/etc. themes into one &#8220;versus&#8221; mix. The particular
  
theme for this first contest is Mega Man 2 vs. Mega Man 4. Any
  
robot master theme from those games is eligible, excluding the <strike>overmixed</strike> popular Wily stages. Entries are due on the first of July.
