Hey everyone. I just found out about thasauce trying to help promote our new album. Very nice site here! Anyway, I&#8217;ve got a remix album of old school video game music that some of you would probably enjoy. Samples are up on the website and the album is available for download off of iTunes and Amazon. Check out some interviews with the people involved with the project to give you more of an idea of what the project is all about.
