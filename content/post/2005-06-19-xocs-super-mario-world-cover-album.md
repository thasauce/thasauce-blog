From out of nowhere, a guy by the name of [XOC](http://www.laspesadillas.com/xoc/xoc2.html) ([Jason Cox](mailto:coxxx666@hotmail.com)) has released a collection of Super Mario World covers.

XOC sums it up quite well himself: &#8220;The complete soundtrack to Super Mario World, covered by one man using
  
dozens of instruments. Roughly in game order, faithful to the
  
originals, with some bizarre artistic license thrown around. A private
  
hobby made public. Dedicated to Koji Kondo&#8221;

Catchy and eccentric, the songs cover all the major themes from the
  
original Super Mario World on SNES, varying in styles from polka(?)
  
to.. well you&#8217;ll just have to listen. The songs are all available in
  
MP3 and OGG.

In other words, [CHECK IT OUT, YO!](http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=opensource_audio&collectionid=xoc_SMW)
