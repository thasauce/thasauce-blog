<a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=14662" target="_blank"><em><em>as posted on ocr:</em></em></a>_</p> 

i build computers as a side business at college. i&#8217;d like to build you
  
a computer. if you&#8217;re within, like, six hours of where i live, i&#8217;ll
  
even drop the thing off for you.  
</em>
  
_why would you take me up on this offer?
  
>you probably don&#8217;t know enough about computers to build one yourself.
  
>**i
  
can build it for you for less than half of what you&#8217;d pay for a similar
  
computer through dell, lenovo (microsoft), hp, acer, etc.**
  
>i can customize it for your specific needs easily. need twelve USB
  
ports? fine! need 4 terabytes of data storage? awesome! want the
  
biggest, most pimped out system using the best components? sounds good
  
to me!</p> 

here&#8217;s how it works.
  
>you pm me, and say &#8216;i want a computer!&#8217;
  
>i&#8217;ll contact you (skype, aim, phone&#8230;anything real-time is ideal)
  
and we&#8217;ll discuss what you want, and how much overhead you&#8217;ve got to
  
work with
  
>i&#8217;ll do a little research, and find out best costs and some timetable information, and get back to you
  
>if you agree, i&#8217;ll order the parts, assemble them, and probably
  
hand deliver the computer to your house. i&#8217;ll install any software you
  
want, and have it optimized for whatever you need.</em>

i don&#8217;t use cut-rate components, or attempt to scam you. i&#8217;ve built
  
thirty-one computers in the last two years for people and i&#8217;ve not had
  
a problem that was caused by my handiwork with any of them. i&#8217;ll even overclock it (stablely) if you want me to.

what i don&#8217;t work with

>apple computers (not worth the time, IMO)

>laptops (definitely not worth the time, no matter what)

why am i doing this?

>i love building computers. the smell of a component fresh from the box is like ambrosia to my senses.

>i enjoy working with the hardware end of computing technology.

if anyone&#8217;s interested (i&#8217;m not planning on a lot of people being
  
interested, but it&#8217;s worth a shot), send me a pm and we&#8217;ll go from
  
there.

it&#8217;s worth noting that i&#8217;ve already have three or four contracts for computers set up (including **escariot**), and another ten people who will be contacting me within the next few months as they get financial means together (including **atma** and **arek**).
  
i generally charge 10% of the cost of the parts for assembly and
  
handling &#8211; which generally winds up being around 50-70 dollars.

if you&#8217;re interested, either email me at bradleyDOTburrAThoughtonDOTedu, or pm me over at ocr, and we&#8217;ll go from there.
