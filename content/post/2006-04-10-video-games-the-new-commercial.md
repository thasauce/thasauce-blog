  According to an article on the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/" target="_blank">CBC&#8217;s website</a>, the creators of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG" target="_blank">MMORPG</a> <a href="http://www.project-entropia.com/Index.ajp" target="_blank">Project Entropia</a> have released a program similar to PowerPoint that allows players to create their own commercials to be used on billboards in the video game.

  So far the adverts are for events and stores in game (Entropia Online, it must be noted, is one of those rare games in which you can transfer real money to and from your account &#8212; provided you want to deal with Swedish banking.), but I speculate that soon enough, You will be seeing live <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/" target="_blank">Coca-Cola</a> ads in more than just Anarchy Online.
