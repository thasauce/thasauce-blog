So, the Doubles&#8217; Dash 2 compo was Sunday, and as expected it was even better than the first! Here are <a href="http://shaelbopp.livejournal.com/702531.html" target="_blank">the results from Shael&#8217;s LJ</a> (I&#8217;m reuploaded the files on ThaSauce &#8217;cause Shael&#8217;s a talented musician but his filenaming/hosting skills aren&#8217;t quite up to par =P. Also: ID3 TAGS >:( ):

  Holy shit! I just hosted the second teams-of-two three-hour pop song<br /> writing party/contest, and the results were absolutely impressive. I<br /> encourage you to check these three songs out.

    You<br /> have to hand it to DJ Projekt Zero, whose partner petered out halfway<br /> through the contest, leaving him with half the time and half the<br /> manpower to finish his song. Zero drew titular inspiration from a<br /> threat made following his partner&#8217;s forfeiture midway through the<br /> contest, regarding what would happen were he to not finish his track.

    Just<br /> like I said I would be, after wearing the producer hat last time, I&#8217;m<br /> in the lyricist/vocalist role on this collaboration with JJT, who<br /> produced an excellent instrumental. When I produced Injury, I wrote a<br /> melody for her to write words to, but Jon just gave me a chord<br /> structure, leaving me to write the melody too; that was cool, because<br /> it gave me some wiggle room with my lyrics. Drawing inspiration from a<br /> conversation I had with <span class="ljuser"><a href="http://treacerbullet.livejournal.com/profile"><img class="ContextualPopup" src="http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" border="0" /></a><a href="http://treacerbullet.livejournal.com/"><strong>treacerbullet</strong></a></span> earlier in the day, I decided to write a song in-character, taking a tip from the Randy Newman school of songwriting.

    These<br /> motherfuckers. Not only did they cheat, by secretly adding Doug &#8220;Sgt.<br /> Rama&#8221; Arely to their team, but they parodied Snow Love and Sludge, the<br /> undisputed worst song off of my first solo album. Fuck you,<br /> cocksuckers. You are not invited to my contests anymore.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Actually, they did a really good job. Starla&#8217;s T-pain&#8217;d vox are stunningly hooky.
