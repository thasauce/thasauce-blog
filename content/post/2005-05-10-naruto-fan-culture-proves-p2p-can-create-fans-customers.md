title: Naruto fan culture proves P2P can create fans, customers

Joi Ito blogs about an exchange he had with his sister regarding an
  
anime fan-scene in Japan. The activity resulting from &#8220;illicit&#8221; Naruto
  
derivations created by fans amounts to a convincing case study for the
  
notion that filesharing can generate new fans and consumers.

  If you go to the site that lists the BitTorrent files of Naruto, you<br /> will see that fans have subtitled the episodes into a variety of<br /> languages like Hebrew, Portuguese, French&#8230; When new episodes of<br /> Naruto come out, the fans get together on IRC and other fora and<br /> collaborate and create subtitled versions and put them online. If you<br /> search for Naruto on Amazon.com, you find a page where the fans are<br /> voting for the DVD release and the notice says that they will notify<br /> the publisher of the voting. (It would be interesting to find out if<br /> the publisher or the fans initiated this.) It also appears that when a<br /> local DVD is released, the fans take down their subtitled episodes for<br /> that region. By allowing the fans to create demand, the publishers are<br /> using these file sharing networks and illegal derivative works as an<br /> extremely efficient form of marketing. Thanks to the network of<br /> Internet anime fans, Naruto is still niche, but popular globally.

  This kind of publisher approved &#8220;piracy&#8221; is not a new thing.<br /> Dojinshi, are comics created by fans of Japanese comics. They are<br /> illegal derivative works. They make their own stories using famous<br /> comics as the base. They have huge conventions and it&#8217;s an amazing<br /> community. The publishers of most of these comics encouraged this<br /> dojinshi culture because they realized that this increases the demand<br /> for the originals. These derivative works and sharing creates &#8220;fans&#8221;<br /> not &#8220;lost customers&#8221;.
