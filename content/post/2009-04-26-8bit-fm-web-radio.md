From GM4A:

<div class="quoted-text">
  Recently I was informed about a very cool and much needed endeavor. It<br /> is an awesome new streaming web radio site dedicated to every type of<br /> video game inspired music. The aptly titled <a href="http://www.8bitfm.com/">8bitfm</a><br /> is that site, and you can head over there and listen right now to find<br /> plenty of nerdcore, VG rock, chiptunes, remixes, and even lots of<br /> straight VGM compositions. So they definitely have it all, no matter<br /> what type of VG inspired tunes you enjoy! They also have <a href="http://www.8bitfm.com/sitev1/on-air-shows">a few daily radio shows</a> for different genres.

  The site just started up but it looks like they are doing everything<br /> right to become a great musical source in the community, so definitely<br /> listen in and keep an eye on these folks!

Admittedly, ever since I&#8217;ve noticed that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.181.fm/playing.php?station=181-chilled&#038;embed=1">internet radio</a> is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.fm/vocaltrance/">pretty much all starla listens</a> to, I&#8217;ve really been warming up to the idea again. Back in the day I used to listen to pretty much exclusively video game music radio and <a target="_self" href="http://ocremix.org">OverClock&#8217;s</a> old streamin radio <a target="_blank" href="http://ormgas.rainwave.cc/">before ormgas came over and took that over</a>. 

That said&#8230;I&#8217;ve been listening to this all morning now =P
