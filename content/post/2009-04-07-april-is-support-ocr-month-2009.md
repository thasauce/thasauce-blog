<div class="quoted-text">
  Last year, djpretzel mentioned in a write-up that <em>&ldquo;Sometimes,<br /> because of our content policy, our LLC status, the amount of content on<br /> the site, or any number of things, people mistakenly think that we&#8217;re<br /> an actual business that has ample resources and makes money, etc. <strong>This<br /> is not the case &#8211; money from all our ads, shirt sales, and donations<br /> combined only barely breaks even these days due to the operational cost<br /> of hosting the site.</strong> In other words, we always need whatever help you can provide.&rdquo;</em>

  The same holds true this year as well. Before I get right to it,<br /> however, I&rsquo;d like to cover a few points. OverClocked ReMix has<br /> experienced some tremendous growth in the last year &#8211; I think it&rsquo;s fair<br /> to say that none of the &ldquo;old-timers&rdquo; ever anticipated how popular it<br /> would become or the impact it would have on so many people on so many<br /> levels. With <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</em>, we managed<br /> to make our way into a major video game franchise, we&rsquo;ve gotten a lot<br /> of positive attention online and through events like Video Games Live,<br /> and we&rsquo;re receiving an ever increasing number of submissions from both<br /> aspiring and renowned musicians from all over the world. Why does any<br /> of this matter? The larger the site grows, the more resources it takes<br /> to keep moving forward.</p>

    Many of you will remember that this time last year, I unofficially declared April to be <strong>&ldquo;Support OCR Month&rdquo;</strong>.<br /> It seemed appropriate, since the site was not only officially standing<br /> on its own two legs, but was growing rapidly, with the cost of things<br /> like bandwidth and hosting quickly outgrowing the limited funds<br /> generated from T-shirts, stickers, hoodies, and ads. Whether you&#8217;ve<br /> personally downloaded one or all of the remixes that are hosted here,<br /> enjoyed any of the album projects, made it to a meet-up or convention<br /> and had a blast, played a game online with friends you&rsquo;ve made here,<br /> learned a skill you didn&rsquo;t have before, improved a skill or ability,<br /> helped someone else in the same way, sit and spent minutes or hours and<br /> hours on the forums, or any combination of these things etc, that&#8217;s all<br /> made possible by djp&#8217;s continued work on the site and our ability to<br /> make such resources available. <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/wiki/images/OC_ReMix_-_April_Fool%27s_Day_2009.png" target="_blank">This year&rsquo;s A1 gag</a><br /> was great, but it&rsquo;s not entirely unrealistic&mdash;that is, the possibility<br /> of losing the battle to site operating costs and watching the site<br /> disappear. In fact, though we <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?p=413235&#038;postcount=303" target="_blank">aren&#8217;t quite in dire straights</a>, we walk closer to that ledge than many people think. </div>
