Jivemaster, also known as Joel Bird and remixer on
  
OverClocked ReMix since his song &#8220;Chemical Juice&#8221; was posted in
  
September of 2000, returned to OCR on Wednesday after a two-year
  
hiatus. His new song, like many of his others, is a remix of a song
  
from the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games. Based on &#8220;Lava Reef Zone&#8221;
  
and &#8220;Hidden Palace Zone&#8221; from Sonic & Knuckles, it is entitled
  
&#8220;Lava Reach.&#8221;

&#8220;This is a remake of an unreleased mix I did back in
  
2001 that I wasn&#8217;t overly happy with,&#8221; Jivemaster said in a letter to
  
djpretzel.      
He forgot about the mix until recently, he said, when he decided to rework it.      
&#8220;&#8230;it was about time to release something again for all the people who have enjoyed my stuff in
  
the past and for those new to OCR who may be saying &#8216;Jivemaster? Who&#8217;s
  
this Jivemaster fellow?!?'&#8221; Jivemaster said.      
11 of his now 14 ReMixes posted on OCR have been
  
from games of the Sonic series, including Sonic the Hedgehog 1-3, Sonic CD, and Sonic 3D Flickie&#8217;s Island.
