  Hey all &#8211; just wanted you to know that our album Get Equipped is<br /> finally out! We&#8217;ve been recording the thing for over a year, but at<br /> long last ran out of things to delay its release any further <img border="0" class="inlineimg" title="Smile" alt="" src="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" />

  Anyway, if you haven&#8217;t heard our stuff before, we&#8217;ve put together an<br /> album based off the Mega Man 2 soundtrack, but we added lyrics to give<br /> each of the characters some extra dimension. We&#8217;ve submitted our<br /> version of the Airman stage theme to OCR, but it is still awaiting<br /> approval. In the meantime, visit our myspace or our official site to<br /> check it out.</p>
