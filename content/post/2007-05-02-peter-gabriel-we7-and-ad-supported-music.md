Star Wars text crawl please:

We7 is set to begin combatting internet music and video piracy in June with an innovative **PAT.PENDING** media graft Web 2.0 technologies and the promise of DRM free trakcs. The problem is that no major labels have signed on yet, but with heavy hitter **PETER GABRIEL** as a founding investor it should be only a matter of time before more popular artists sign on. The service is not limited to big name artists, either, as Gabriel was quoted saying &#8220;We7 provides artists&mdash;even across the more experimental or minority
  
genres&mdash;with the opportunity to build a new source of income from their
  
music.&#8221; A similar service, **SPIRALFROG** offers DRM encumbered tracks at the price of one or more video advertisements prior to download, and already has two major labels sign up, **EMI MUSIC PUBLISHING** and **UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP**.
