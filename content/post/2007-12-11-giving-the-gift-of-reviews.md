<div class="quoted-text">
  So it&#8217;s that Christmas month again, and last year BGC started a really<br /> cool movement to get some lesser-listened-to songs more reviews. I<br /> think it&#8217;s a great idea, and I want to bring it back this year.
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  Basically, there are tons of songs that have less than 20 reviews, and<br /> even some with less than 10. I say we all try to find at least one song<br /> a day that we haven&#8217;t listened to, or haven&#8217;t reviewed, and try to beef<br /> up those review threads.</p> 
  
  <p>
    So, take a few minutes and grab a song you haven&#8217;t heard, or maybe<br /> listen to one you haven&#8217;t reviewed and take a little time to write some<br /> comments!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And, for the lame ending sentence, <br /> &#8220;Give the gift of reviews!&#8221;</div>
