Jeux-France recently <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news18999.html" target="_blank">interviewed</a> Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer of Chrono Cross, concerning several projects at Square Enix. To summarize, the news is that it&#8217;s currently too difficult to reunite key personnel involved with the Chrono series to try and develop a new game. Here&#8217;s hoping to Masato Kato and buddies getting back together (and getting the hell away from Mana) to make something new. Please click read more for Tanaka&#8217;s comments on the Chrono series.

Q: I know you&#8217;ve worked on Chrono Cross. There are a lot of fans of
  
this game even here in France where it wasn&#8217;t released, so could we
  
expect to see a sequel, one day?

(Tanaka takes a huge breath when he hears the translation, then he
  
laughs a little bit, as if he had been expecting the question or
  
something&#8230;)

A: Well, the problem with Chrono Cross and Chrono Trigger is that, the
  
Chrono series is what it is because we always had a very particular
  
team to develop it. Chrono Trigger is kind of the &#8220;game of the miracle&#8221;
  
because it was a period when great creators like Akira Toriyama and
  
others were available at that moment, and that&#8217;s how the game could be
  
made. And for Chrono Cross it&#8217;s the same thing. The producer for Chrono
  
Cross who is now the scenario writer for Secret of Mana 4[see note 1],
  
the producer for Chrono Cross who was Mr Kitase[see note 2] who is now
  
very busy on the Final Fantasy games since the VII or VIII&#8230; And so
  
this means that it&#8217;s very difficult to be able to reunite the original
  
team, to be able to make a sequel to the Chrono series&#8230; Simply
  
because if we don&#8217;t try to reunite these people but take other people
  
instead, we will find ourselves at that point with a game which will
  
feel different, since there would be different persons in charge and we
  
would possibly lose the Chrono spirit, if we make a sequel that way.

Q: So for the moment it&#8217;s a no?

A: As of now, there is no sequel planned.

[Note 1] Unless Tanaka slipped and accidentally revealed the name of a
  
new, still top-secret project or something, the interpreter is probably
  
referring to Seiken Densetsu 4 alias Dawn of Mana, which has just been
  
released in Japan. And of course, the scenario writer referred to is
  
Masato Kato, who was not producer for Chrono Cross (that&#8217;s Tanaka right
  
here!) but director.
  
[Note 2] Yes, the interpreter says &#8220;producer for Chrono Cross&#8221; twice,
  
he made a little mix-up. Kitase was co-producer for Chrono Trigger, not
  
Cross. I think Tanaka also mentioned in Japanese the name of one of the
  
other co-producers for Trigger, Tokita, but the translator just said
  
Kitase. Don&#8217;t criticize him, it&#8217;s hard to translate Japanese to French
  
orally with all those names and functions!

Well, if you have ideas for supporting the development of a new Chrono game without resorting to
  
the &#8220;WTF SE SUX, WARE IS CRONO I MAEK PETITION&#8221; attitude, give the Compendium a ring.

Thanks to MasamuneCyrus for bringing this to attention and Chrono&#8217;99 for translating.
