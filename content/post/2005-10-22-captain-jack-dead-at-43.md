Cuban-born dance music artist Franky Gee, better-known to his European fans as &#8220;Captain Jack,&#8221; has died of a brain haemorrhage while in Spain, German media reported on Saturday. He was 43.
  
In a 10-year career that began in 1995, the former U.S. soldier and one-time German stock broker sold more than 7 million albums and singles, earning 19 gold and platinum discs with titles like &#8220;Drill Instructor&#8221; and &#8220;Soldier, Soldier.&#8221;
