Yes, tomorrow night, at precisely 10pm, Radio ThaSauce Live makes it return after six week hiatus due to moving, adjustments, and Otakon! I&#8217;ll be bringing the phat beats, so strap yourself in, and hang on tight!

A lot has happened since the last time I did the show, and hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to cover it all, but we&#8217;ll see. Friday&#8217;s show has no time limit, normally it runs two hours long, however, I&#8217;m not going to set a limit on this particular show, so please, just show up and enjoy!
  
To view the show, go here:Â <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/radio-thasauce-live" target="_blank">http://www.ustream.tv/channel/radio-thasauce-live</a>

&#8212; By the way, I do take requests. They can be made via IRC (on EnterTheGame) in channel #thasauce before and during the show. If you can&#8217;t get on IRC, please make your requests via PM on these forums, or in the chat via the radio show&#8217;s web page.

A few things of note, I&#8217;m going to be putting together a dedicated web site just for the radio show itself. I believe there is an embed code that I can copy into my code for the site so that everyone can just go there and chat and listen to the show. I will once again attempt to use the web cam for the show, however, if there are issues with the feed (there were last time), I won&#8217;t use it after this point. But, it was a good idea, right? Anyway, web site forthcoming, and listen to the show tomorrow night!
