  Ok so you all may have noticed AR&#8217;s been down for a while. Well, Avaris<br /> actually told me while we were at MAGFest that AR was back up. I talked<br /> to Xaleph just now and he doesn&#8217;t actually know why AR is actually back<br /> up, but it is.

  We also haven&#8217;t been able to contact our host [he won&#8217;t<br /> even answer his emails] during the downtime, however Xaleph DOES have a<br /> backup plan to move the site if this happens again, so don&#8217;t worry!Also,<br /> happy new year! 2009 should see many new cool things happening with AR,<br /> like dev.animeremix going live! And hell, maybe some new songs too!</p>
