It&#8217;s Sunday night, let&#8217;s get some LINKS! The last week has unfortunately been kind of&#8230; weak, but there&#8217;s still a bit of material to share.
  
This weekend, a demoparty in Germany, <a href="http://www.evoke.eu/10/" target="_blank">Evoke</a> happened. A bunch of my Renoiser friends went [<a href="http://www.renoise.com/board/index.php?showtopic=13569" target="_blank">read here</a>] and had a blast. I&#8217;ll have to wait for MAGFest for something like this, but there were plenty of compos with plenty of great stuff. In the thread on the Renoise board, there&#8217;s links popping up to songs made by the crew that attended.

Yes, that dblue. I don&#8217;t hear Glitch used anywhere though. A pretty cool SID-like dance tune, with good energy, deep bass, and sexy lead. Also a speak n spell. Reminds me of Machinae Supremacy without the metal :3

This is an AWESOME drum n bass track. &#8220;the vocals originate from a three second indian chanting snipped which is totally copyrightless and got alienated to the max.  <img border="0" alt="wink.gif" src="http://www.renoise.com/board/style_emoticons/default/wink.gif" />as the party crowd didn&#8217;t seem to enjoy this very much, maybe you or somebody else can.&#8221; I dunno why the hell the party crowd wouldn&#8217;t enjoy this, I certainly am. This is the kind of sound you&#8217;d expect from a pro &#8211; awesome synths, sounds, and good mixing.

That&#8217;s all for the Evoke music for now. I might have more music from this event in next week&#8217;s post.

<a href="http://www.sakari-infinity.net/" target="_blank">Sakari Infinity</a>, an original game music site, has a new design, and with the exception of the HUEG header it looks pretty good. Click around and you&#8217;ll find some neat tracks for use in videogames.

<a href="http://reunion.sgxmusic.com/046%20-%20SGX%20-%20Have%20No%20Tyrant.mp3" target="_blank">SGX &#8211; Have No Tyrant</a>, which I linked to last week, was uploaded to <a href="http://www.reunionstudio.org/music.html#046" target="_blank">Reunion Studio</a>. SGX and Reunion seem to be getting along very well together. This is his third single on Reunion so far.

In other news, <a href="http://www.mono211.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1186342858/4#4" target="_self">Simon reads my column</a>, and so should you and all your friends. I wonder what I&#8217;ll find if I follow referral links like him&#8230;
