Juan P. Medrano, alias Sixto Sounds, is a man who lives by his state&#8217;s standard: Everything&#8217;s bigger in Texas. His remixes are big on the rock, heavy on the guitar, and huge on the quality. Whether it&#8217;s remixing a track from a classic Ninja Turtles game or from a recent entry in the Tales of series, he&#8217;s doing it, and doing it well. Being a contributor to OCR for 5 years, half the time it&#8217;s been around, he&#8217;s built up a stable of 20+ tracks, including one to the Dwelling of Duels that&#8217;s been <a title="Dwelling of Duels link removed due to site being down" href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR02070/" target="_blank">accepted and updated</a> over at OCR and a self-admitted <a title="HOT BULLETS OF SHOTGUN TO DIE!" href="http://remix.thasauce.net/song/RTS0207/" target="_blank">ThaSauce exclusive</a>. I recently interviewed him, and this is what he had to say.

Mirby: What started your interest in video game music?

Sixto: Hmmm&#8230; well, as a kid i didn&#8217;t play video games THAT much. I dabbled in a little Nintendo, little bit of Sega. But there were some games like Punch-Out!!, Afterburner, Sreet Fighter 2, [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV] Turtles in Time where the music just kind of stuck with me. In my head I could always here the music being played by a live band.

M: I was the same way (just different games).

S: Anyway, once I picked up guitar at around 11-12 years of age, I pretty much forgot about video games; wasn&#8217;t till maybe 2004 that a friend shared some MP3s with me. Remixes from OCR; It was Prot&#8217;s <a href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00569/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brainsick Metal</a> and djp&#8217;s <a href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00368/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GerudoInterlude</a>.

M: Two of my favorites! Nice!

S: Yeah, that really drew me into the site and that&#8217;s when I started listening to the music of all these older games I used to love&#8230;

M: And that&#8217;s what started your interest in remixing tracks yourself, I take it?

S: Yeah, exactly; I figured, why not?

M: Are there any tracks you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re more proud of, or like more, than the others?

S: Let&#8217;s see&#8230; Well, my favorite one might be my Super Hang-On remix &#8220;<a href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR01771/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Burn, Baby, Burn</a>.&#8221; I think I like it the most because, well, I went in with the idea of making it sound a certain way&#8230;

M: Actually, I haven&#8217;t heard that one. So I&#8217;m going to get it now. I actually have no idea how I missed it&#8230;

S: Hehe. I wanted to give it this 80s kind of feel. Not so much 80s metal or anything. Also, this was the first time I was able to get everything sounding just the way I wanted.

M: That&#8217;s pretty cool! To continue, which do you prefer; solo tracks, or collaborations?

S: I prefer the solo stuff. To be honest, i&#8217;ve never really collaborated, per se&#8230; Except for one time, with zircon, on the FF7 project [<a href="http://ocremix.org/album/1/final-fantasy-vii-voices-of-the-lifestream" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Voices of the Lifestream</a>].

M: <a href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR01640/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lunatic Moon</a>?

S: Yeah. In that track, zircon and I wrote together. In all of my other collabs the music had pretty much been written out already.

M: Great track, one of my favorites. Especially with your 45 second or so guitar solo type thing.

S: I do wish I could re-do it; it&#8217;s not one of my favorites.

M: Ah, well a true artist in never satisfied with their work, I suppose.

S: True that.

M: Any tracks you&#8217;d like to remix in the future?

S: Tons!

M: Such as?

S: Well, I&#8217;ve got about 23 project tracks i&#8217;m working on; stuff from Megaman X games, Final Fantasy 9, the Dragon Quest games&#8230; Lots of stuff. Plus, I&#8217;m going to be remixing another track from Turtles in Time, which is probably my favorite game soundtrack.

M: For the <a href="http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=22663" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boss Themes</a> project?

S: Yeah.

M: And it is a fairly epic soundtrack.

S: That it is.

M: Fun game too, for that matter.

S: Definitely, even today. That re-shelled version is so great.

M: Re-shelled? Is that some sort of re-release for XBLA or something?

S: Yeah; a remake of the arcade game in 3D. It&#8217;s really fun when you play online with 3 friends.

M: That it would be.

M: Do you have a favorite track from a game?

S: Hmmm&#8230; That&#8217;s a tough one. It would be a toss up between Ken&#8217;s Theme in Street Fighter 2 or Sewer Surfing from Turtles in Time.

M: Both of which you&#8217;ve remixed.

S: Right!

M: Do you have a favorite video-game composer?

S: I&#8217;d probably have to say Motoi Sakuraba. I love Nobuo [Uematsu]&#8217;s Final Fantasy stuff, but I dunno&#8230;

M: He&#8217;s pretty cool. Tales games and Golden Sun, that&#8217;s all that really needs to be said

S: I&#8217;ve always liked how Motoi writes; more of a modern style. Yeah, I love the Tales soundtracks and the Star Ocean&#8217;s.

M: I always liked how there&#8217;s a Sakuraba (and Sakuraba III) in Tales of Phantasia. One last question. What do you enjoy most about remixing?

S: Well&#8230; I like recording and mixing music. Period. I just love doing it. It feels like it&#8217;s something that comes naturally to me. Remixing video game music, though&#8230; I guess I just love being part of such a big community, being able to make something that other people enjoy. I still haven&#8217;t met any of these people as I&#8217;ve never been to MAGFest or a meetup, but I&#8217;d like to some day.

M: Well you&#8217;re being interviewed by one right now. Thank you for your time. It has been an honor, Sixto.

S: Anytime.
