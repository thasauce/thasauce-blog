**ANIME REMIX HALLOWEEN COMPETITION 2K7!**
  
Villains always have the coolest themes. This competition revolves around &#8220;scary&#8221; anime, &#8220;evil&#8221; anime music, and villain theme songs. We also accept normal remixes that are simply scary (like a spooky chobits mix or something). This is the biggest Anime Remix yearly competition.
