There&#8217;s an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62899">interview with Uwe Boll over at Eurogamer</a>. I can honestly
  
say I agree with some of the things he says, like how people should SEE
  
his movies before JUDGING them, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that
  
he makes complete crap 90% of the time. He talks about his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279037/">movies<br /> before before <em>House of the Dead</em></a>, how &#8220;video game movies are
  
hard to sell to production companies&#8221;, and probably most interesting:
  
about his upcoming POSTAL movie&#8230;

_&#8220;&#8221;I&#8217;m in the movie &#8211; Uwe Boll will play a minor part. I get killed by my
  
&#8216;Boll haters&#8217;,&#8221; he explains. So will he be getting real, er, Boll
  
haters to play themselves?&#8221;</p> 

</em>Can you say **selling point?** 
  
All in all it&#8217;s an interesting read, to say the least. Sue me, but I from what I read this Postal movie even sounds somewhat _worth_ _watching._ Granted, it&#8217;s still gonna be an Uwe Boll movie, and it&#8217;ll still likely be LAUGHABLY BAD, it DOES have a few things going for it:

A) Gary Coleman
  
B) Uwe Boll Dying
  
C) Osama Bin Laden

I&#8217;m willing to see it based on those 3 things **alone.** Granted,
  
I&#8217;m not gonna pay for it, but to be fair I haven&#8217;t payed for a movie in
  
over 2 years because I have friends at movie theaters. Oh well, that&#8217;s
  
just my take on the whole thing.

**PS:** Thanks for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&#038;u=2386">Ace-Of-War</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=77566">his thread on OCR</a>, for pointing this one out.
