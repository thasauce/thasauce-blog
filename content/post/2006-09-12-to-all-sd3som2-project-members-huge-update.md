<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=2577387">The Seiken Densetsu 3 project</a>, after recent hacker attacks at its last forums, now has <a target="_blank" href="http://sd3.thasauce.net/">new and beautiful looking forums</a>!<a target="_blank" href="http://sd3.thasauce.net/"></a>
  
All members are to register immediately if you can. WIPs can be
  
posted, rated and criticized. Please wait at least a couple days for
  
Usa or TheDeath to verify you as a member of this project (private
  
forum sight).

Otherwise to say, this is a huge step for the
  
project. From my point of view (note: biased), this advances the
  
project by many steps because of the new way to communicate. Usa and
  
TheDeath thanks ThaSauce for being an awesome host and website.
