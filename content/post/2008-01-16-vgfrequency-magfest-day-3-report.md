Larry has finally gotten his Saturday report of MAGFest up <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=433">posted on the VGF blog</a>. It outlines the OCR panel, the Saturday concerts, and includes the creepiest picture of him ever with Elaine of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/selectstartband">Select Start</a>.

    After missing Day 2, I was definitely ready to get back on the horse for <strong><a href="http://magfest.org/">MAGFest</a></strong>. OC ReMix had its panel that day, so of course I represented my homebase. Along with <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/djpretzel/">djpretzel</a> and <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/liontamer/">myself</a>, fellow judges <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/zircon/">zircon</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/pixietricks/">pixietricks</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/biggiantcircles/">Big Giant Circles</a> and <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/member.php?u=9431">CHz</a> were on board the panel presentation that day for an impressive show of staff power.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rather than going through our traditional presentation for the<br /> uninitiated, we were in front of a crowd where the major majority of<br /> people were already familiar with OverClocked ReMix. This year, we<br /> highlighted all the important developments at OCR for 2007, including <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=138"><em>Voices of the Lifestream</em></a>, <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=21">attending Video Games Live</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=10165">the debut of the Content Policy</a>, <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=232">revising the Submission Standards and Instructions</a> and developing translations of our most important information for several languages. OCR&rsquo;s latest album project, <a href="http://rd.ocremix.org/"><em>Radical Dreamers</em>: <em>Thieves of Fate</em></a>, released during <a href="http://www.myspace.com/magfest">MAGFest</a> itself, was given a preview to the audience by director <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/theprophetofmephisto/">Brad &ldquo;the prophet of mephisto&rdquo; Burr</a>, to an excellent reception.<em> </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Highlighting upcoming developments for 2008, we&rsquo;ve got some great<br /> stuff on the way. Our first live full orchestra arrangement from <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/game/wild-arms-ps1/"><em>Wild ARMs</em></a> is on the way, we&rsquo;ve got our first mother-son ReMix collaboration as well from <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/kingdom-hearts-chain-of-memories"><em>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</em></a>. <a href="http://www.djpretzel.com/">djp</a><br /> showed off his plans for swanky new composer pages that&rsquo;ll show off a<br /> lot more information about the men and women who inspire the<br /> contributors to OCR, using <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/composer/id/70/tim-follin/">Tim Follin</a><br /> to give the people a look at how composers are laid out with more<br /> information than ever; look for that to go live in the next few days.<br /> We also pimped some AMVs including clips of some of the <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=187"><em>Voices of the Lifestream</em> AMV contest</a> (soon to be judged so that we can get those swanky prizes out there) as well as the <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=121">Spittin&rsquo; Narcissism fanvid by Psycosis91</a>. Plenty of good stuff to promote, not even taking into account our bread and butter of posting creative, free ReMixes.

    After a huge dinner with the OCR meetup group, it was time for the<br /> second and final night of concerts. Let&rsquo;s go short and sweet: The<br /> moshing this year was definitely toned down a great deal compared to<br /> last year. Not that anyone was cracking down on it, there just wasn&rsquo;t<br /> nearly as much this year as last. Let&rsquo;s not also forget props to <a href="http://www.no-carrier.com/">NO CARRIER</a> and <a href="http://audiovideo.sevcom.com/">noteNdo</a><br /> for the NES-created visuals that adorned both nights of performances.<br /> You&rsquo;ve got to see it to believe it, they were a nostalgic acid trip.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.vgmetal.com/">Powerglove</a> was excellent. They<br /> always have an unbelievable amount of energy to their performances,<br /> including some badass costumes. I personally hate the <em>Power Rangers</em><br /> theme, but when they played it for some brief non-VGM material, they<br /> definitely got the crowd going. I would have loved to have seen <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=98">Chris Marchiel&rsquo;s Guitar Hero synth</a> in play, but was perfectly glad &ldquo;settling&rdquo; for some awesome material from <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=247"><em>Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man</em></a>, including <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=168"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;So Sexy Robotnik</a>&ldquo;!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was legitimately worried that <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/selectstart/">Select Start</a>, <a href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/?p=178">in their first MAGFest performance</a>,<br /> wouldn&rsquo;t be as much of a draw with the crowd, who are used to rock and<br /> metal VG cover bands acts, but the masses turned out in a big way. We<br /> probably could have used some chairs during their set, since there was<br /> no reason to stand up for the whole thing. They put on a really classy<br /> performance. Frontman Austin Harley started off a little shaky with the<br /> opening solo on one track, but regrouped with a joke and was off to the<br /> races. The best part of the set had to be when the crowd exploded with<br /> whooping and applause to the end of the first track, which visibly took<br /> the entire sextet by surprise.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    When I talked to violinist Elaine Li after the set along with <a href="http://www.biggiantcircles.com/">Big Giant Circles</a>,<br /> she confirmed that the group had never received that kind of reaction<br /> ever before in their history of live performances, and that it was<br /> great to be in an atmosphere where everyone already knows and respects<br /> game music, making it so much easier to get immersed in the<br /> performance. Indeed, hearing <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01171/"><em>Metroid</em> &ldquo;Kraid&rsquo;s Hideout&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01549/"><em>Chrono Trigger</em> &ldquo;Theme of Frog&rsquo;s&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://dod.vgmix.com/past/decjan06/03-SelectStart-FF3-Eternal-DoD.mp3"><em>Final Fantasy III</em> &ldquo;Eternal Wind&rdquo;</a> live was a big highlight. Along with <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/mustin/">Mustin</a> and <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/ktriton/">ktriton</a><br /> joining in for one song, the crew did a great job with their first<br /> MAGFest appearance, so hopefully they walked away already thinking<br /> about how to return next year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.thisplaceishaunted.com/">This Place is Haunted</a><br /> played their final show with guitarist Michael Motorcycle, who&rsquo;s<br /> leaving the band to begin medical school. Who would have pegged him for<br /> it? (We at VGF wish him the best of luck, to be sure.) The band&rsquo;s set<br /> was a lot more of a balance between VGM and other retro material (The<br /> theme to Sanford and Son??? Let&rsquo;s throw it on there!); I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m<br /> partial to VGM and would have appreciated more&hellip;exclusivity on that<br /> level. I mentioned to <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/shaelriley/">Shael Riley</a>, who&rsquo;s a big fan of the band, that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thisplaceishaunted">This Place</a><br /> just has some impeccable chops. Both Michael Motorcycle and Epileptic<br /> Peat were playing some really involved runs and solos with just pro<br /> precision; it was quite a sight to behold being so close to the stage.<br /> Here&rsquo;s hoping these bros regroup somehow so that they can keep putting<br /> out quality material, especially because they spotlight tons of<br /> otherwise obscure VGM to arrange.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Last but not least, the final band of the night was The Smash Bros. Running strong from <a href="http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=189">their performance at the 2007 <em>Final Fantasy XI</em> Fan Festival</a>, MAGFest&rsquo;s house band took on a new flavor with <a href="http://www.ktriton.com/">ktriton</a> replacing <a href="http://www.myspace.com/shawnphase">Shawn Phase</a><br /> on drums and doing an amazing job; there was definitely a great amout<br /> of synergy between him and the rest of the band. Before the set<br /> started, we were all instructed to listen to the noise playing over the<br /> speakers. A few of us thought it was rain SFX until a wonderful smell<br /> wafted across the concert hall. In between tracks, <a href="http://www.oneupstudios.com/boards/member.php?u=619">Pappy</a> and <a href="http://www.oneupstudios.com/boards/member.php?u=34">Joe Cam</a><br /> were cooking bacon outside the hotel and feeding it to the crowd!<br /> Enhancing the experience was a microphone brought over to the pig meat<br /> so that the entire crowd could hear it sizzling. I was able to snag a<br /> full-sized strip of bacon in the first wave of free pork before the<br /> bros had to start cutting it up to offer it to everyone. Definitely a<br /> hilarious bonus, the crowd chanted &ldquo;Bacon! Bacon!&rdquo; with ferocity with<br /> every break. The eclectic VGM set of the Bros. (<a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/ailsean/">Ailsean</a>, ktriton, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/midee/">Midee</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/norg/">norg</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/prozax/">Prozax</a>, Roy McClanahan & <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/composer/id/36/jake-kaufman/">virt</a>) included <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/game/un-squadron-snes/"><em>U.N. Squadron</em></a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/game/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-nds/"><em>Phoenix Wright</em></a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/game/earthbound-snes/"><em>EarthBound</em></a> and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/contra-4"><em>Contra 4</em></a><br /> in easily the most diverse set of the festival. They need to record<br /> their shows via the mixing boards at MAG and sell, sell, sell.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyone who doubts whether or not they should attend MAGFest would<br /> become a believer if only to experience the greatness of even one night<br /> of the concerts, and that&rsquo;s only one night out of four days. I&rsquo;ll be<br /> back tomorrow to wrap up the rundown of my time at MAG.
