From <a href="http://www.soulcalibur.com" target="_blank">SoulCalibur.com</a>:

_I&#8217;m sure by now many of you have heard the rumors from Japan and I&#8217;m
  
here to say most of them are correct. Granted, I can never keep up with
  
everything people say so it&#8217;s impossible to confirm everything._
  
_Soul Calibur III: Arcade Edition is a re-tuned, re-vamped, and most
  
importantly, fixed version of Soul Calibur III. Naturally, all glitches
  
found in the console version have been fixed. In addition to that,
  
we&#8217;ve re-tuned the overall balance of many moves and re-vamped Amy,
  
Hwang and Li Long as official characters. All three have been revised
  
into more unique move sets and help to expand the already expansive
  
Soul Calibur III line-up.</p> 

We expect Soul Calibur III: Arcade Edition to release within six weeks. Stay tuned for more information.</em>
