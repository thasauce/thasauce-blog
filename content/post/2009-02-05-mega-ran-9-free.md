From <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/s-kill/blog/2009/02/04/mega_ran_9" target="_blank">Capcom-Unity.com</a>:

<div class="quoted-text">
  Unity favorite <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/megaran" target="_blank">Random</a><br /> has finished up his new album and made it available for the low, low<br /> cost of FREE.Â  The album isn&#8217;t just entirely inspired by Mega Man&#8211;it&#8217;s<br /> entirely inspired by Mega Man *9*Splash Woman is my favorite so far, but download the whole thing <a href="http://sharebee.com/55086f01" target="_blank">here!</a></p>

I had the pleasure of meeting Random when I met up with <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=192144655" target="_blank">myf</a> at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/nerdapaloozafest" target="_blank">Nerdapalooza</a> here in Orlando last year. Really great guy. Really talented, too. I thoroughly recommend this to any Mega Man / Hip-hop fan.
