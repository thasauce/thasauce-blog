So, um, hi guys! My name is MagiNinjA. I&#8217;m an old admin here and I&#8217;ve been inactive for a while (according to Rama, a million years), and when I come back, I&#8217;ll some guides and tha shizzle (haha, that should be a rapping compo for tha sauce XD). As an admin, I mainly report stuff, write/edit guides, and suggest stuff. Basically, I track the details. I also have stuff in the works to help you out you musicians and power users.
  
Now! Tha News! Unfortunately, some of our <a href="http://www.hellven.org/" target="_blank">more distant relatives of ThaSauce</a> released an album! LAST YEAR!! As far as I know, this was not posted, but was mentioned on <a href="modules.php?name=News&#038;file=article&#038;sid=208" target="_blank">Larry&#8217;s Saucy Year-In Review</a>.

Also, a buddy of mine nicknamed <a href="http://carbohydrom.free.fr/" target="_blank">CarboHydroM</a> released some shizzle. Songs, drawings, photos, etc. There is also a new layout if that wasn&#8217;t reported. Looks beautiful and very <a href="http://carbohydrom.free.fr/music/CarboHydroM_-_Unsealed.ogg" target="_blank">Unsealed</a>-esque. He also organized the whole lot of songs. Very nicely done.
