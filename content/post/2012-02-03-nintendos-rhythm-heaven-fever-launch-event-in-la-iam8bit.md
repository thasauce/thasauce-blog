Party-goers, unite! Nintendo has teamed up with Los Angeles-based production company [iam8bit](http://iam8bit.com/) and [Giant Robot](http://www.giantrobot.com/) to promote Nintendo&#8217;s upcoming groovalicious gameÂ _Rhythm Heaven Fever_ (Wii). While [the game itself looks rather interesting](http://www.destructoid.com/preview-rhythm-heaven-fever-induces-grooving-220663.phtml), we&#8217;re more intrigued with the fact that Nintendo will host a party at the iam8bit gallery in Los AngelesÂ **nextÂ Friday, February 10th from 6-10 p.m**. Multiple highlights of the party include hands-on time with the game before the scheduled February 13th release, refreshments and music throughout the evening, and the chanceÂ to film and submit clips to be included in a specialÂ _Rhythm Heaven Fever_Â <a href="http://rhythmheaven-jointhegroove.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">interactive video experience</a>.

While the event is public, Nintendo has specifically announced that it will be on a first-come, first-served basis. The iam8bit Gallery is located at 2147 W. Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, California. See you there!
