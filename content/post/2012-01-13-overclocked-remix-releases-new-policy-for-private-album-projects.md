[OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) overlord [djpretzel](http://www.djpretzel.com/) has recently released a new policy to announce the source material and directors of private album projects in order to tackle problems with other potential projects of the same game:

> We&#8217;ve recently decided (duh) that it&#8217;sÂ **not fair to the community to have these private projects be COMPLETELY private**Â &#8211; at the very least, we&#8217;re going to announce the names of games being worked on, so would-be directors can decide for themselves whether to start their own projects from the same games. Again, to be clear, these are private albums being run by directors who prefer to do things that way, which IS an option that we respect & allow, so we&#8217;re not going to release any additional information about these projects OTHER than the game name, and we ask that everyone respect the wishes of the director(s) who choose to run their projects this way. By the same token, though, we decided that keeping the actual names of the games private was problematic & not transparent.

Currently, the two private projects Â that have been approved by OverClocked ReMix are _Final Fantasy VI_ and _Banjo Kazooie_. To keep up-to-date on the list of current OCR projects that will be released , you can [view the thread here](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=25764). If you happen to be interested in the starting an official project for OCR and/or project approval,Â [Â guidelines are also available here](http://ocremix.org/info/Project_Guidelines).
