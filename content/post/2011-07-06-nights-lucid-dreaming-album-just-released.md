In an earlier update, we [recently mentioned](http://thasauce.net/2011/06/27/trailer-released-for-nights-lucid-dreaming/) the trailer release for [Stevo â€œLevel 99â€ Bortz](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/level-99/)â€™s long awaited project. With over thirty talented musicians skillfully arranging tracks from Sega classic _NiGHTS into dreamsâ€¦_ over the past two years, this project highlights the first Sega Saturn title to receive an [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) album.

Today marks the official [release](http://www.nightsintodreams.com/) of _NiGHTS: Lucid Dreaming_! Directly created by fans for fans, this project features a diverse array of genres that have been influenced by the NiGHTS musical dreamscape motif. _Lucid Dreaming_ has also had the luck of being the first OC ReMix album to be heard by both the game&#8217;s creators and lead composer.

With the project intending to promote the music of NiGHTS into dreamsâ€¦, Bortz recalls about his own unique vision for the project: &#8220;To me, _NiGHTS into dreams&#8230;_ defines what the essence of the Sega of old was: creative, original, adventurous, and memorable. The music was the most memorable part of the game for me: I&#8217;ve been listening to the soundtrack for 15 years now. Despite being a cult classic, _NiGHTS_ has not received its due attention over the years. Two years ago, I started this album, hoping to pay respect to the music, the game, and their creators through art and sound. I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of the amazing work everyone put into this album, and I hope you all enjoy it!&#8221;

So there you have it. Congratulations to OC ReMix, Bortz, and everyone involved for giving us such a solid album. _NiGHTS: Lucid Dreaming_ is available for free download [here](http://lucid.ocremix.org/).
