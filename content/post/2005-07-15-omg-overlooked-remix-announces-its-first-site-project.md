OMG! <a target="_self" href="http://www.olremix.org">OverLooked ReMiX</a> announces its first site project launch: [OMFSKÜLFAGGER](http://skuljagger.paletteswap.com/),
  
a Sküljagger (SNES) collaboration. The project features 8 shitty,
  
weird or funny (?) remixes, plus a suicidal pirate. How can you pass
  
that up??
