EARTHBOUND PAPAS [have recently introduced an official contest](http://www.dogearrecords.com/Earthbound_Papas/arrange_eng.html) to remix or arrange &#8220;Metal Hypnotized&#8221; to promote their hit album, _Octave Theory._ According to contest rules, there are no limitations to _how_ you can actually remix or arrange this song, as instrumentals and lyrics may be played or replaced with other members.Â ParticipantsÂ may also choose to include friends or collaborate with others. EARTHBOUND PAPAS will also listen to each submitted track to choose the winner on **February 14th, 2012**, Â who will thenÂ appear as a guest performer on the next EBP album.Â The contest _will end_ on **January 31st, 2012**.

For those interested, EARTHBOUND PAPAS&#8217; sound data may be downloaded [here](http://pub.idisk-just.com/fview/fXTRrRNM-3tKjVz8ft9rKveugWzHrD-tlRgLdHlaeSDFgbW_eg8v2KAlZ1Bc-o_NYZXOTPBz7Pw-h4mBzB7JFw), but remember that the use of these filesÂ outside of the remix/arrange contest or in public and secondary media is strictly prohibited.Â You**_Â mustÂ post your remix/arrangement as a video response_** on YouTube, but no movies or pictures are required on the video. We have also included the video that you need to &#8216;respond&#8217; to join the contest above. Good luck!
