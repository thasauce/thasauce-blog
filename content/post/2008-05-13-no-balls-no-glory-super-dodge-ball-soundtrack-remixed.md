From <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/no-balls-no-glory-super-dodge-ball-soundtrack-remixed-85803.phtml" target="_blank">Destructoid</a>:

<div class="quoted-text">
  <a href="http://noballsnoglory.net/" target="_blank">No Balls, No Glory</a><br /> is an internet EP release by The Bad Dudes, a multinational group of<br /> musicians that releases covers of video game music. This release<br /> contains 16 remixed songs from Kazuo Sawa&#8217;s original score for the 1989<br /> NES game, all arranged with each dodge ball team&#8217;s country of origin in<br /> mind.

  Project Producer Mustin said, &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about releasing this project in conjunction with Aksys games and their Brawlers release. I hope the music pays suitable tribute to the Super Dodge Ball video game we all played as kids.&#8221;
