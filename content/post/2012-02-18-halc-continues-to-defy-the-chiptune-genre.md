Even though he is known to reign within OverClocked ReMix&#8217;s judges panel, [halc](http://albums.halc9bit.com/) is definitely on a roll. Following his January release of the wonderfully ambient album _[Zer0-G](http://albums.halc9bit.com/album/zero-g)_ that could single-handedly define the chiptune genre even further_,_ halc has bestowed upon us yet another EP chock-full of electro-house goodness:

> _No Song Left Behind_ is a collection of newly polished and remastered chiptune-house style tracks produced over the course of 2010-11. These were all written for various albums which never saw the light of day (a testament to my inability to write house music, and more importantly, to stick with it :P).
> 
> Rather than let them continue to stagnate on my hard drive, I&#8217;ve decided to release them together as a free 3 track EP. A token of thanks for the amazing support and response towards Zero-G. As always, all donations are lovingly appreciated! Enjoy!

Previewing some of _No Song Left Behind_ briefly, we have to say that halc&#8217;s work takes the &#8216;chiptune-house&#8217; style to another level, proving how much he has progressed as an independent artist over the course of the last few years. Although deviating from _Zero-G&#8217;s_ chill vibesÂ and _[Trending Topic EP](http://albums.halc9bit.com/album/trending-topic-ep)_&#8216;s dubby in-your-face presence_,_ halc&#8217;sÂ unassuming yet fluent transitions inÂ &#8220;Bicycle Rights&#8221; get will get your head bobbing involuntarily. As you preview some of the EP below, you can get _No Song Left Behind_ for free on [halc&#8217;s Bandcamp](http://albums.halc9bit.com/album/no-song-left-behind-ep)Â (be sure to check out his other albums while you&#8217;re at it!).
