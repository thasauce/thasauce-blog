  So Xerol posts his album, I figure I&#8217;d post mine. Last month I released a short ambient EP [an EP is basically a short album, 20 minutes or less, or in oldschool terms a 7&#8243; vinyl]. So far I&#8217;ve recieved nothing but positive feedback, which I guess is a good thing, so if you like ambient you might like this. It&#8217;s basically 4 tracks and 16 minutes of music.

TOTALLY SHILLING RIGHT NOW

  My upcoming projects are a chiptune disk for Anime ReMix and a &#8220;spiritual sequel&#8221; of SoundTempest called The Fifth Garden. I will also likely create another album for Auld Lang Sine 4, whenever Ubik decides to announce that.
