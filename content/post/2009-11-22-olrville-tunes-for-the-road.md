After 5 months of blood, sweat, and tears (mostly tears because nobody
  
understands what a &#8216;deadline&#8217; is), OverLooked ReMiX proudly presents
  
our latest site project, **OLRville &#8211; Tunes for the Road**!
  
The album is a collection of different town/city themes, done in the traditional OverLooked style of making blood flow from your ears while you listen.  8 tracks of ReMiXy goodness from guys like Brunzolaitis, Zimish One, and nesper!

Click the picture (or follow the link -> <http://olrville.olremix.org>) and grab the .zip if you want everything, or have a taste-test with the songs first!  And if you are feeling so bold, leave some comments in [the official thread](http://olremix.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8859).

You can give your props to Zimish One (aka POCKETMAN in some places), as he is the project coordinator and I don&#8217;t even know which site project this is for him&#8230;probably his 6th or so.

(also, this is an announcement that our queue is fixed, so you can submit songs again!  yay!)
