Ahhh, July 4th draws near&#8230; This episode might not be &#8220;special,&#8221; but
  
surely the temptation of remix reviews, reports, general silliness, and
  
an Australian meetup call-in is too powerful to pass up. Not to mention
  
we&#8217;ve got the continuation of our trivia contest, along with the
  
announcement of last week&#8217;s winner (pics too!). Prepare for at least a
  
few pronunciation-related jokes on this one. Now, we recorded all this
  
for the peoples. All you have to do is giddy-up, grab the show, and [vote fer us](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140). Yeehaw!

### VGDJ: Shownotes #047 {.post-title}

[00:00] Even slightly addled celebrities love VGDJ!

[01:26]
  
We wish a happy Independence Day to our American listeners. As for our
  
non-American listeners? THBBBPPPPT. Join us as we commit acts of
  
lollygagging and tomfoolery in our [OCR thread](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=58435&sid=053a7f77d43a0067b15aaaf98db1819e). Also, it&#8217;s a new month, so the rankings on [podcastalley](http://podcastalley.com/) are cleared: thusly, [please vote for us](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140)!

[05:05] We&#8217;re
  
considering recording a special episode (in between our normal
  
releases) centered around the basics of ReMixing and how you can get
  
started. If you&#8217;re interested and have suggestions for the type of
  
stuff you&#8217;d like to hear about, [post in our thread](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=58435&sid=053a7f77d43a0067b15aaaf98db1819e) or send us an email; vgdjpodcast@gmail.com .

[07:07] The Rama Report: 🙁

[07:59] ReMix Review: From [Starfox 64](http://www.ocremix.org/game/starfox64/): &#8216;[V to the X Power](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01488/)&#8216; by [DZComposer](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/dzcomposer/) &#8230; A prominent contributor to the [ReMixing forum](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=7&sid=ce12871634385e9d17200dabe818b3dd)
  
on OCR, DZComposer specializes in orchestral mixes as well as Starfox.
  
He does not let us down here with an intricate &#8211; albeit, slightly
  
esoteric &#8211; arrangement. Those accustomed to dramatic, film score-esque
  
orchestral mixes might be a little disappointed in this, but we
  
recommend it nonetheless.

[11:10] ReMix Review: From [Zelda 2](http://www.ocremix.org/game/zelda2/): &#8216;[Battle of the Hylian Hero](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01489/)&#8216; by [Random Hero](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/randomhero/)
  
&#8230; Ok, so we weren&#8217;t feeling this one too much. It&#8217;s got all the
  
makings of a solid orchestral ReMix, but we thought it lacked a certain
  
expansiveness in comparison to the original, and that it relied on
  
repetition too much. Perhaps we&#8217;ve been spoiled by all the exquisite
  
orchestral mixes already on the site, so by all means, dig the track
  
and make your own opinion.

[14:08] The Compo Report: [FLMC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86523&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), [PRC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86378&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), and [TOMC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86086&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0). Elegantly presented as always, Chad.

[16:44] The first winner of the VGDJ Awkward Trivia Giveaway contest has been selected: it&#8217;s q-pa! Congratulations! We&#8217;ll be sending him a copy of [SGX](http://sgxmusic.com/)&#8216;s
  
newest album &#8220;Chroma&#8221; as well as his remix album &#8220;Better Than Sliced
  
Beats.&#8221; q-pa&#8217;s anecdote involved him joining a university band and
  
playing the bagpipes, which in and of itself is somewhat amusing, but
  
he also sent us pictures of himself. In a kilt. You can see those in [our album](http://vgdj.net/album/),
  
of course. For everyone else that sent in something: it was a tough
  
choice for us, as there was lots of funny material in there. You still
  
have several more chances left!

Anyway, this week, it&#8217;s up to you to prove to us that you&#8217;ve really
  
been listening; how do both pixietricks and I pronounce the following
  
ReMixer names: chthonic, ambient, McVaffe, and Shnabubula? In addition,
  
we want to know the most embarassing CD (or MP3) in your music
  
collection. Leave your answer as a voicemail at 1-800-990-VGDJ. Don&#8217;t
  
forget to email us your physical address so that we know where to send
  
your goodies. As with last week, you have until noon Thursday (July
  
6th) to send in your answer.

[21:02] The Meetup Report: Bzzzzzzzzt&#8230;. The [Otakon meetup](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84273) (at [Otakon 2006](http://www.otakon.com/default2.asp)
  
of course) already has a good fourteen expected participants, and don&#8217;t
  
forget about the OCR panel at 10am August 4th! A good chunk of people
  
have expressed interest in a [Utah meetup](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86508) in Salt Lake City, so if you&#8217;re in the area, [check that thread](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86508). Lastly, the [Brisbane and Sydney meetups](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=83917) have finally happened: hooray!

[23:37] The
  
folks at the Brisbane meetup (Dr. Wily, BlueMage, JamPaladin,
  
Snooper1989, GSlicer, and Jivemaster) recorded a little something for
  
us. Sounds like they had fun! Check out the thread for pictoorz.

[25:50] Russian ReMix Roulette: Ah-bay? Ayb? It looks like pronunciation is the theme of this show.
  
It has been suggested that we start keeping score&#8230; (zircon edit: not
  
if we count the Japanese composers!) But anyway, some old-school beats
  
from [BenCousins](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/bencousins/) today. From [Zelda: Link&#8217;s Awakening](http://www.ocremix.org/game/zeldalinksawakening/): &#8216;[AnimalVillageGreenwichVillage](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00743/)&#8216;.

[32:10]
  
Having seen each other three times in the last few months, we muse a
  
bit on how fun OCR meetups can be, and how they can really make the
  
community more tight-knit. Also, pixietricks pwns Noob&#8230; get it? :>
  
Anyway, we be chillin&#8217; up in Pville again, and hopefully we&#8217;ll be
  
seeing the brothers Riley, DCT, and McVaffe soon too. Hey, we gotta
  
take vacations too sometimes.

[37:23] Arguably, this is the first time in over a month that we haven&#8217;t
  
had a special episode.. though, one might consider the July 4th theme
  
to be special, in a way. But I&#8217;m sure our loyal fans with 56k don&#8217;t
  
mind a less than 50 minute episode. [VOTE](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140) since it&#8217;s a new month, and send in your feedback to vgdjpodcast@gmail.com or post in our [OCR thread](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=58435). See ya next week!
