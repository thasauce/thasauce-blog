So recently on the OverClocked ReMix forums, ReMixer <a href="http://ocremix.org/artist/4391/gecko-yamori" target="_blank">Gecko Yamori</a>, started a discussion on the worst game music ever. Here&#8217;s a quote from his first post in the thread:

> After browsing numerous forums and watching &#8220;best game music&#8221; threads
  
> pop up every month with the same shit listed over and over, I thought
  
> I&#8217;d make an effort to catalouge the worst aural offenders in games. Once
  
> I have enough material I&#8217;ll pick the 10 worst ones and make a fancy
  
> YouTube presentation.

**Edit:** _As it turns out, the GeckoYamori made the thread awhile ago, but Txai has [recently resurrected the discussion](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=16956&page=10)._

So far my nominees are:

  * A Boy and his Blob: This makes Banana Phone sound like Chopin.
  * Cruis&#8217;n USA: Would have picked Daytona USA, but the constipated Elvis
  
    impersonator trumps it on every level.
  * Mega Man 2 (Game Boy): I have no idea if the composer intentionally
  
    tried to pursue some avant garde disharmonic statement here.
  * Doom (32x): I know it&#8217;s not easy to get the most out of the YM chip, but
  
    this sounds just like they hastily ran the MIDI files through a
  
    converter and didn&#8217;t even bother to manually touch them up afterwards.
  
    Which makes sense given that the entire game was one big rush job.&#8221;
