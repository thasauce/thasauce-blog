For a nation that promotes equal accessability in nearly every aspect of modern life, the United States is severely lacking in one aspect: Handicapped accessable gaming. The blind, the deaf, and para/quadriplegics have few choices when it comes to gaming. So much so that the standard &#8220;disabled friendly&#8221; game is a boring &#8220;happy, fluffy&#8221; game. What the balls is this?!

So read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/technology/reviews/chi-0704090175apr10,1,4689848.story?coll=chi-technologyreviews-hed">this Chicago Tribune article</a> and let me know what you think.

Cheers.
