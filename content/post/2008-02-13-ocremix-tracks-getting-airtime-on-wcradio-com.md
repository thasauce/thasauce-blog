&#8220;_Just posting a quick note to let the community know that the entire
  
archive of OCRemix tracks is on our 24/7 playlist on WoW Radio (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wcradio.com/">http://www.wcradio.com</a>),
  
played on our live talk-shows, and incorporated, with proper
  
accreditation, into our podcasts as music breaks. We have checked the
  
terms of use and to our knowledge are fully complaint with the OCRemix
  
license and regulations. Any artist who does not wish to be a part of
  
our programming, feel free to email <totalbiscuit@wcradio.com> and we&#8217;ll have your material removed.

&#8220;A little background on our organization. WoW Radio has been running for
  
over 3 years providing original talk-show content to the World of
  
Warcraft community. We currently service over 125,000 unique listeners
  
a month, and over 750,000 podcasts are downloaded every month from our
  
site. Our content is available through all major RSS-compatible
  
distributors including iTunes, and our live stream can be listened to
  
through our website via any shoutcast compatible media player.</p> 

&#8220;Thanks again to this community for providing such a wealth of quality
  
content. We hope we can help give you the exposure you deserve.</em>&#8220;
