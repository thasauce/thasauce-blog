Just got the news from starla. <a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/news.php?extend.114" target="_blank">This was posted on Ormgas</a>:

  Since the cat is out of the bag due to the poll I might as well give you the full story. </p> 
  
  <p>
    Yes, ormgas is shutting down in the beginning of July. Some of you will<br /> be upset and many of you saw it coming miles away and won&#8217;t really<br /> care.

  One of the reasons for this is that I&#8217;m moving to a new apartment and<br /> will lose the 100/10MBit fiber connection for a poor 24/1 ADSL<br /> connection. Another, fairly huge, reason is that time and interest have<br /> been fading away for me and w-ber for a very long time. We have had<br /> some very good ideas about what to do with the site, how to redesign it<br /> and which features to implement, but we&#8217;re simply out of time. </p> 
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;ll try to write up a longer forum post summarizing the life of ormgas<br /> and things that were discussed behind the scenes but never saw the<br /> light of day.
