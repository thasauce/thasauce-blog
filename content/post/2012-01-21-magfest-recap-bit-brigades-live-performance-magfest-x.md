You know a band is good when an entire audience exclaims, &#8220;Holy s*$%! Holy s@#$!&#8221; as loud as humanly possible even when the deafening clashes of drums and bass throes overwhelm the piercing yells of spectators. This kind of incredible energy is what [Bit Brigade](http://www.bitbrigade.com/), self-described as &#8220;epic technical rock&#8221;, brought to the table at [MAGFest X](magfest.org). Composed of members from various math rock bands, Bit Brigade manages to pursue the final boss into the gates of hell and back through their exuberant enthusiasm on-stage. If you weren&#8217;t there for the monumental leg-thrashing to some of the best renditions of your favorite Megaman theme songs, you can catch **forty-four minutes of awesome** above. We just wanted to show the world justÂ _how much_Â Bit Brigade&#8217;s heart-stopping show melted our faces off.
