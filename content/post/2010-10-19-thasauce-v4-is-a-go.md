Finally. FINALLY. After months and months of seemingly not much, ThaSauce 4 is ready for launch. Let me be the first to warn everyone that the site may have some problems, but fixes will be rolling out quickly now that the new site is live.

Some new features include:

  * FINALLY ditching Php-Nuke entirely for WordPress
  * An all new look and feel that will hopefully provide readers with easier readability and navigation.
  * News comments now totally integrated with the forums
  * And many MANY features to come that will totally change how you interact with the site.

Right now the forums are still a work in progress. If you had an account on the old forums, you should be able to log into the new PhpBB3 forums, but they will be VERY ugly. I&#8217;m working on it. The PhpBB3 default theme is fighting me tooth and nail, but I shall prevail. Formatting from the forum comments on the site comments is a bit messed up too, but I assure you all this is but the tip of the iceberg!

I also don&#8217;t have a working version of Photoshop right now (GASP, right?) so that&#8217;s why the thumbnail images look like butt. I&#8217;M GETTIN&#8217; THERE.

Thank you, enjoy, and STAY TUNED for more upcoming changes.
