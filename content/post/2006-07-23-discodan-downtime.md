We haven&#8217;t had a REAL featured song in quite sometime, but someone made <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=87865" target="_blank">a thread on OCR</a> about an old song Dan made, it and made me dig up some of his old stuff&#8230;
  
Downtime is one of the most truely amazing remixer originals ever. Dan really outdid himself when he made this song some odd 4-5 years ago. It&#8217;s a MUST LISTEN for everyone and is highly recommended.

And yes, this song was made with Fruity Loops. Likely Fruity Loops 3 infact.
