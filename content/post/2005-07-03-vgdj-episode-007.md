This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/): Interviews with Darkesword and Adhesive Boy about their involvement with the Kirby&#8217;s Adventure Project &#8211; Rise of the Star. Aussies invade the show and Rama does something cringeworthy on this Kirby heavy, and 39 minute long (!), special (in that &#8216;short bus&#8217; kind of way) episode.
