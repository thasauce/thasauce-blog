News has been
  
breaking recently about a plethora of new films derived from video
  
games, don&rsquo;t expect the drought of original ideas in Hollywood to go
  
any time soon.
  
  
First up,
  
Ain&rsquo;t It Cool News Vin Diesel will portray the shaven-headed contract
  
killer known only as Agent 47 in a film based on the successful **Hitman**
  
games. Funny how a series of games most obviously influenced by
  
numerous movies is being made into a game. Imagine how derivative this
  
film could end up looking to people who have never heard of the games,
  
it&rsquo;s convenient that the film studios have this &lsquo;video game filter&rsquo;
  
they can put these films through in order to make them appear fresh.

Uwe Boll has yet _another_ goddamn film project, he will be [wasting his time adapting **Postal**](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3141458).
  
For those who have never played either of the Postal games, they were
  
average games where a guy basically goes crazy and starts killing
  
everybody. Boll claims he&rsquo;ll be keeping all of the &lsquo;original
  
characters&rsquo; but with his own hideous Boll-fied story. I&rsquo;m sure it will
  
involve people jumping in the air in slow motion a lot. Add this to the
  
list of Boll projects based on games that also includes the soon-to-be
  
critically panned **Bloodrayne**, **Hunter: the Reckoning** (did anybody actually play this game?), **Dungeonsiege** and **Far Cry** and damnit, I really liked Far Cry too.

Finally, because you idiots actually paid to see the first two, we&rsquo;re getting [two more **Resident Evil** movies](http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/06/13/news_6127452.html). Part three will be called **Resident Evil: Afterlife**
  
and Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, this time they will be shooting in
  
Australia and pretending it&rsquo;s a Southwestern American desert. Evidently
  
American deserts are just out of control when it comes to charging
  
filming crews these days. **Afterlife** will be based on a script
  
by, joy of joys, Paul W. S. Anderson, I&rsquo;d love to get a look at it and
  
see the eight million cues for slow motion shots. Part four is already
  
planned and will be set in Japan, whether it&rsquo;s a good idea to plan a
  
third sequel before the second has even started filming remains to be
  
seen, **The Matrix** this is not.
