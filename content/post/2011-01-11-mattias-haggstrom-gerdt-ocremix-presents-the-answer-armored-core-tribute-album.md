[Anso](http://anosou.com/) has been working on his Armored Core Tribute album for quite some time now, and yesterday it was [released via OverClocked ReMix](http://answer.ocremix.org/index.php). The full includes 11 arrangements from songs throughout the Armored Core series and features vocals by [DragonAvenger](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/dragonavenger/) and [Jillian Aversa](http://www.jillianaversa.com/).

The artist had this to say:

> [&#8230;] THE ANSWER is for all of you who really have no clue about the ravens, Line Ark, how to build the fastest AC, how to defeat White Glint or Nine-Ball Seraph. You who didn&#8217;t get nostalgic when playing the Revolution part of Armored Core: Nexus, who haven&#8217;t tried to figured out the vocals for Remember, who doesn&#8217;t tear up when hearing &#8216;Someone is Always Moving on the Surface&#8217; and who doesn&#8217;t miss &#8216;Shape Memory Alloys&#8217; on the newer soundtracks.

Much to my personal dismay it seems [Shape Memory Alloys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ykG6lle8w) was not actually included on the album; A song that has defined the Armored Core series for me throughout the years. Regardless, Mattias has once again put together an excellent piece of work worthy of praise.
