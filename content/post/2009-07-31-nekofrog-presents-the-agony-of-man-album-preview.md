    My debut album is nearing completion, but for a few reasons that cannot be revealed here, it will be some months before it finally sees an official release. Until then, I figured I&#8217;d throw up a preview of what&#8217;s to come. This preview consists of two fully completed (length-wise) songs, and one abbreviated song.

    Entitled &#8220;The Agony of Man&#8221;, this album features a trilogy of songs depicting the birth, life, and death of a man, detailing the major events that define his tragic life. It also spans various different genres of metal, including thrash metal, progressive metal, death metal, melo-death, and many others.

    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMKKHq43mao&#038;fmt=18" target="_blank">Track 1</a>: This song is entitled &#8220;Overdose&#8221;, and is unrelated to the trilogy. Some of the other musicians that I&#8217;ve shown the project to have described this song as progressive/melodic death metal, however it lacks any type of vocals. So if you&#8217;re one of those types who likes the guitar of melodic or progressive death metal but can&#8217;t get past the cookie monster vocals, this is probably right up your ally.

    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ME5A2aVi9A&#038;fmt=18" target="_blank">Track 2</a>: This song is entitled &#8220;The Funeral&#8221;, and is the middle part of the aforementioned trilogy. It details the death and laying to rest of the man&#8217;s wife, and his regret at having ever met her and inadvertently causing her death. EMO FAGGOT. Vocals (yes, this song has vocals) were recorded by DrumUltima of, derp, OCR fame.

    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdy51Oof7Fw&#038;fmt=18" target="_blank">Track 3</a>: This song is entitled &#8220;Descent&#8221;, and is unrelated to the trilogy. This song takes elements from thrash metal more than anything, with some fast riffing near the fadeout. This track is going to be a doozy when the full thing is unleashed ðŸ™‚

    In the coming months, a few more tunes might be &#8220;leaked&#8221; up until the album&#8217;s final release. Thanks for listening, I&#8217;d appreciate some comments if you enjoyed it, or otherwise.
