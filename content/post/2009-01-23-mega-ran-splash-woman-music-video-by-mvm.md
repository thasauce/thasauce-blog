  This is one awesome video, and song! Arizona emcee <a href="http://www.myspace.com/random215">Random, AKA Mega Ran</a><br /> is currently working on a project entitled Mega Ran 9 (guess what game<br /> it is about). I suppose this can be considered the first single from<br /> that album. The music video is made by my good friend over at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MusicVidMayhem">Music Video Mayhem</a>, and he definitely knows how to make an ace VGM video!
