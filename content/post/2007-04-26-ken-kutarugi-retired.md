Who even saw this coming? Anyone? According to an article linked to on OCR by <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/member.php?u=13898" target="_blank">SilverStar</a>, this <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/playstation/ken-kutaragi-steps-down-at-playstation-255545.php" target="_blank">article</a> from <a href="http://www.kotaku.com" target="_self">Kotaku.com</a> says it all. Finally, we can all breathe a breath of fresh air and hope that within the coming months Sony will have been shocked to the core enough to lower the price on their latest console, the PS3.

Only time will tell.
