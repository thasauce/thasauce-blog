Fans of Metroid and Blake Robinson can look forward to **March 19th** &#8212; that is when Synthetic Orchestra will release <a href="http://www.metroidorchestra.com/" target="_blank">Super Metroid Symphony</a>.

For those of you not familiar with Symphonic Orchestra.

> <p style="text-align: left;">
>   The Synthetic Orchestra is <strong>Blake Robinson</strong> and his collection of ultra-realistic sample libraries and software. Born in London, England, Blake Robinson has been obsessed with computer generated music from a young age. From his humble roots as a kid hacking away at <em>Protracker</em> on his <em>Atari ST</em>, Blake now utilises a top-of-the-range workstation to create epic orchestral pieces and lush symphonic soundtracks from the comfort of his home.
> </p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This time, Blake is orchestrating music from the Super Nintendo game <strong>Super Metroid</strong>, composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano.
