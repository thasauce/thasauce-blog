From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=7098">GAF</a>:  
_  
This morning I got an email from my Pascal, Marketing Manager over at
  
Lik-sang. Normally, these emails are about some sort of sale they have,
  
preorders for new systems like PlayStation 3, or other happy business.
  
But today it was about Sony forcing Lik-sang out of business with legal
  
bullying tactics. In general, the way legal matters of these type work
  
is that the company with the most resources wins and this case is no
  
different.
  
_ 
  
_Forget that Lik-sang was merely an exporter, a practice which is
  
completely legal in most countries in the world. Forget that they were
  
about giving gamers choice (and free stickers with every order). Forget
  
that while Sony dropped the ball on the PS3/PSP launches in Europe and
  
Australasia, Lik-sang tried to give those gamers what they wanted.</p> 

Rather than retelling the whole sordid story, I decided it&#8217;d be best to give you the press release unfiltered.
