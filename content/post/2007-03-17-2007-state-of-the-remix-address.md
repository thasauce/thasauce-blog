d-to-the-p-rizzle had this to say this year <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=8426" target="_blank">over @ OCR</a>:

_This post/announcement was supposed to happen back in January, when
  
2006 was relatively fresh on our minds and significant portions of the
  
new year had not yet expired, as has occurred with some degree of
  
regularity in the past. Better late than never; that I&#8217;m making it in
  
the middle of March probably reinforces a couple of the themes I
  
planned to cover anyways, so in a way it&#8217;s appropriate._
  
_**First, old business&#8230;**</p> 

2006 was a landmark year for this site. The single biggest change was
  
something that wasn&#8217;t particularly visible to the average user, but
  
which has made a huge difference in the direction the site has taken:
  
it was the year that OverClocked ReMix was migrated off shared hosting
  
and onto a dedicated server that I alone administer. Prior to this
  
development, OC ReMix was hosted for free by ZTNET, L.L.C. in Michigan,
  
who also host many emulation and gaming sites for free. These guys are
  
great &#8211; if a book is ever written about the history of console
  
emulation, they&#8217;d show up as the philanthropic web hosts of tons of
  
emulators and news sites. Granted, all revenue generated from
  
advertising and shirt sales also went to them, to help cover OCR&#8217;s
  
considerable bandwidth overhead, but this site wouldn&#8217;t have existed
  
without someone willing to front the cost, as it would have been
  
prohibitive for me during the early years.

I&#8217;m happy to report that that&#8217;s no longer the case &#8211; the combination of Google ads, affiliate revenue from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.estarland.com/showban.asp?action=redir&#038;campaign=139">eStarland</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zzounds.com/a--925434">Zzounds</a>, etc. and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.estarland.com/showban.asp?action=redir&#038;campaign=163">shirt/hoodie</a>
  
sales combined cover the complete operating costs of the site, with a
  
little leftover to print more shirts and coordinate events. If you shop
  
using Amazon, you can also use the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/amazon/">OC ReMix Amazon Outlet</a>, and a portion of each sale goes to the site. Every little bit helps, believe me.

As an interesting side note, a couple unsung heroes of 2006 were **two donators that collectively donated $2000 to the site**.
  
I tried contacting them to thank them (profusely) and see if they at
  
least wanted shirts, but it seems they preferred to remain relatively
  
anonymous. Their combined donation was what me made confident enough to
  
proceed with migrating the website to its own dedicated server, which
  
was a smooth process that&#8217;s been nothing but successful so far.
  
Everyone who&#8217;s donated or helped out in any way has played a part in
  
getting OCR to where it is today, but these individuals
  
disproportionately acted as a catalyst for this development, and for
  
the ensuing shirt order that was made, and they deserve singling out,
  
albeit in an unnamed manner.

So, what does being on our own server mean? For starters, the site&#8217;s
  
been faster and more stable. Sure, it was only a matter of degrees, not
  
a quantum leap, but it&#8217;s still been nice. The folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liquidweb.com/?RID=ocremix">LiquidWeb</a>,
  
where our box is hosted, have also been amazingly helpful when we&#8217;ve
  
run into any issues, so our downtime has been limited. The increased
  
speed of the site has also let me make more regular backups, so I feel
  
more comfortable with our disaster recovery capability. But none of
  
that&#8217;s too sexy to the average visitor; one of the bigger things that&#8217;s
  
occurred as a result of all that, however, is that we (rather smoothly)
  
transitioned from our old forum software, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a>, to the more powerful and consistently updated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vBulletin</a>.

I hate to do this, but I feel like I philosophically have to&#8230; while I
  
love the open source community, and this site runs largely on open
  
source software, I think that **phpBB
  
represents a failure of a large, popular, and very visible OSS project
  
to responsibly manage software development goals and operate on
  
anything approaching a professional timeline**. Sure, they responded
  
quickly enough to the myriad security holes that were found with their
  
forum software, and still do, but the confusion surrounding phpBB 3.x
  
and the refusal to continue adding much-needed features to the
  
widely-deployed 2.x line has made many admins wary of the package, and
  
prompted just as many to jump to more powerful, more secure, or more
  
streamlined alternatives. It&#8217;s frustrating to see software that was at
  
one point at the top of the heap stagnate for so long; when phpBB 3.x
  
finally comes out, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be great, but what about the years in
  
between, when 2.x became obsolete and insecure? Alright, I&#8217;ve bitched
  
enough about that&#8230; moving on&#8230;

OverClocked ReMix&#8217;s site development philosophy centers around **stability, gradual growth**, and a **consistent online presence**.
  
We&#8217;ve been doing this for over six years, now, and we&#8217;ve never been
  
down for more than a couple weeks and have never gone more than a month
  
without posting something. We&#8217;ve constantly added incremental features,
  
rather than throwing the whole thing out and starting over, and I think
  
the permanence and cumulative momentum of this path is something we can
  
be proud of. There&#8217;ve been hiccups, rifts, layout additions that (ahem)
  
took some getting used to (cough&#8230; sidebar), but I don&#8217;t feel like
  
we&#8217;ve ever really tripped and stumbled. This may come off as an
  
implicit diss at another game remixing community, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgmix.com/">vgmix.com</a>,
  
so I&#8217;ll just come right out and say that it&#8217;s not &#8211; there&#8217;s room on the
  
INTARWEB for two sites about game mixes, they&#8217;ve got a radically
  
different approach, and last I heard variety was a good thing.

Server migration and vBulletin weren&#8217;t the only developments in 2006,
  
of course. Far from it; here are some other items of interest, with
  
apologies to anything or anyone I&#8217;m missing:</em>

  * _First female judge appointed to panel (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/pixietricks/">pixietricks</a>)_
  * _<a target="_blank" href="http://sf2.ocremix.org/">Blood on the Asphalt: A Super Street Fighter 2 ReMix Collaboration</a> released_
  * _<a target="_blank" href="http://chrono.ocremix.org/">Chrono Symphonic</a> released_
  * _<a target="_blank" href="http://s3k.ocremix.org/">Project Chaos: A Sonic 3 & Knuckles Arrangement Album</a> released_
  * _Partnership with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.estarland.com/showban.asp?action=redir&#038;campaign=139">eStarland</a> established for selling shirts and hoodies_
  * _OC ReMix officially attends <a target="_blank" href="http://www.otakon.com/">Otakon</a> 2006 and holds a pretty darn popular panel, where Jill hugs a guy dressed up as a tentacle and hilarity ensues_
  * _<a target="_blank" href="http://www.chipamp.org/">Chipamp</a>, a &#8220;Winamp Chiptune Plugin Bundle&#8221; and OCR project released (over 10,000 downloads to date)_

_In
  
addition to these highlights, we had judges and moderators come and go,
  
we improved site searchability, added a Wiki (with limited editors) for
  
better organized site information, some of us attended <a target="_blank" href="http://www.videogameslive.com/">Video Games Live</a>
  
in Philly and hung out with Tommy Tallarico and other game composers of
  
note, and special props should go out to Jill for coordinating many of
  
these events and to Larry Oji for improving the quality and accuracy of
  
our site database and guiding us through a second lockdown.</p> 

In a word, we **grew**. 2006 was phenomenal. Expecting 2007 to
  
be better would probably be optimistic, since many of these events
  
could only happen once in the history of the site. Also, it sounds
  
obvious, but throughout all these releases, additions, events, and
  
developments, we also did a little thing that happens to be why most of
  
you visit in the first place: **we continued to post some amazing music from some very talented artists**.

**And now, some new business&#8230;</p> 

</strong>2007 will probably be a
  
less eventful year for OverClocked ReMix, at least from the perspective
  
of major site changes. We&#8217;ve got more powerful forums, we&#8217;ve got a
  
better server, we&#8217;ve got mirrors and we&#8217;ve got shirts and hoodies (or
  
had them, until they sold out&#8230; more on the way!!), so those issues
  
have been addressed. In talking about this year, I&#8217;m going to split my
  
comments into two sections. First, I&#8217;m gonna get all mushy and talk
  
about my personal life a bit. I rarely do this in these addresses, but
  
it&#8217;s pertinent&#8230; I think&#8230; and I feel like it warrants expressing.
  
Secondly, I&#8217;m gonna address some of our tangible plans for this year,
  
which is probably the more exciting stuff for most if not all of you.

How does a site like this come into existence? Better yet, not to pat
  
myself on the back, but how the hell does one dude who works for a
  
living find the time to administer it, develop it, participate in it,
  
and also create ReMixes of his own? I&#8217;m gonna try to make this the only
  
time I discuss this particular point about OCR, because if repeated
  
it&#8217;d sound dangerously close to emo whining and livejournal fodder. 

Running this site has had a severe impact on my personal life.
  
Especially from 2000 to 2004, when I (arguably) should have been doing
  
a lot of things that most people in their early twenties do, I was
  
focusing an inordinate amount of time and energy here. In recent years
  
that&#8217;s changed and I&#8217;ve managed to reconcile having what most people
  
would call a life with running OCR, but that&#8217;s a four year dent that I
  
can&#8217;t get back, period. Do I want it back? If I could trade it for
  
everything OverClocked ReMix has come to represent, would I do it? I
  
think not. Nevertheless, in recent years I&#8217;ve focused on delegating
  
more, streamlining where possible, not getting overly involved in
  
dramarama and intersite/intrasite politics, and I&#8217;ve also gotten better
  
at software development and administration, which has reduced the
  
overall workload.

I still have plans for this site, some minor, some major, that still
  
require significant investments of my personal time and the time that
  
our site staff so graciously contribute, but more and more I&#8217;m also
  
making sure that I devote time to living my life. For the last couple
  
years, it&#8217;s been working out, and in recent months I&#8217;ve barely spent a
  
single weekend at home, as certain drunken IRC ramblings that were
  
unfortunately logged will testify to. The moral of this story is, while
  
I might be a little scarcer, I&#8217;m focusing on spending the time I do
  
have to work on OCR more effectively, and it&#8217;s been successful thus
  
far. I&#8217;d advise anyone that spends tons of time on personal projects or
  
other goals like OCR to take a step back every once in awhile; I don&#8217;t
  
regret the investments I&#8217;ve made, but I also don&#8217;t regret refocusing
  
and adjusting so I could spread things out a bit more.

**_(begin second, more specific, part)_**

That&#8217;s all rather relevant to one of the themes for 2007, which is
  
integration with some of the larger social networking sites on the
  
Internet, and other relevant services. Some of you may have noticed
  
that an additional field was added to your forum profile for storing a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a>
  
username, if you have one. This is the first of many planned steps to
  
integrate not just last.fm, but other large networks, into OCR (and
  
vice versa), to whatever extent is possible. Plans include:  
</em>

  * _**Prominent links to OCR groups on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>**_
  * _**Integration with various aspects of Last.fm&#8217;s data feeds and services**_
  * _**Additional user profile fields for other identities, such as Xbox Live gamertags, Wii numbers, etc.**_
  * _**Integrating forum threads with more areas of the site, potentially consoles, game series, etc.**_

_These are all loosely coupled with the idea of making OC ReMix a bit more&#8230; **social**.
  
I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that adding these features will create a
  
stronger sense of community, more interaction, and an expanded user
  
base overnight, or even at all, but I do think they could _potentially_ open up some new doors, and I&#8217;m interested in seeing where it all could go.</p> 

Another big goal is for OverClocked ReMix to be **registered as an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company">L.L.C.</a>**;
  
while this doesn&#8217;t mean much for the end user, it&#8217;s long overdue,
  
protects yours truly should we ever get into legal trouble, and will
  
pave the road for other developments by making me more comfortable with
  
our official status.

Of course, there are some **fantastic site projects** on the
  
horizon, more great mixes on the way, and we&#8217;ll continue to refine
  
aspects of the site that benefit from it &#8211; all of that&#8217;s almost a
  
given, but shouldn&#8217;t be taken for granted. The **expansion of our site database**
  
to include data not explicitly linked to individual ReMixes is also
  
something I&#8217;ve been toying with, that may or may not happen depending
  
on time constraints. A **new release of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chipamp.org/">Chipamp</a>** should definitely be expected, with support for even more formats. **Bumper stickers** may finally show up over at eStarland. 

And&#8230; who knows? These are just a few of the ideas that I&#8217;ve got right
  
now. Feel free to chime in on this thread about how you think &#8217;06 went,
  
what you think of our plans for &#8217;07, and any _specific_
  
ideas you think would also be worth considering in the months to come.
  
As always, I&#8217;m grateful to have the privilege of running this site, and
  
thank each of you for your varying forms of participation and support.

Sincerely, **</p>
