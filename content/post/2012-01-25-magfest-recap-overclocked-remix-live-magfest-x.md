  Even in the midst of exciting news such as potential website redesign and official project updates, OverClocked ReMix really knows how to go all out.  Between  these special highlights, stimulating workshops on the basics of making VGM remixes, and the crazy camaradie of the OverClocked After Dark show at MAGFest X, we've managed to include a brand new arrangement of Donkey Kong Country's "Aquatic Ambiance" with live instrumentals at the OverClocked ReMix Panel.

Even in the midst of exciting news such as website redesign and official project updates, OverClocked ReMix really knows how to go all out. Â Between Â these special highlights, stimulating workshops on the basics of making VGM remixes, and the crazy camaradie of the OverClocked After Dark show at MAGFest X, you would feel inclined to think that nothing could really top the usual excitement of OCRemix&#8217;s panels. However, we&#8217;d be doing OverClocked Remix a disservice if we didn&#8217;t talk about the OCR Live performances, which were absolutely off the hook this year. Just to give you a little taste of OCR Live, we&#8217;ve managed to include a brand new arrangement ofÂ Donkey Kong Country&#8217;s &#8220;Aquatic Ambiance&#8221; with live instrumentals Â by [OA](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/oa/), [Level 99](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/level-99/), [DragonAvenger](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/dragonavenger/), and [diotrans](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/diotrans/) at the OverClocked ReMix Panel.
