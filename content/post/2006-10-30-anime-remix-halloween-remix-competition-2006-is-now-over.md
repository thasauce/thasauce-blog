[Here is the votepack](http://soundtempest.net/soc/remix/ARHRC2K6.RAR)

<div align="justify">
  Hey guys & gals, the AR Halloween contest is over. We have four<br /> very different entries from four very special guys ;). Anyway, if you<br /> like anime music, check this votepack out and send me votes if you<br /> like. Order the songs from best to worst and I&#8217;ll put them in my<br /> magical compo vote machine and it&#8217;ll spit out fancy results. PM me if<br /> you&#8217;re a member of any forums we go to together, or email me [overcoat<br /> at gmail dot com] and vote that way.<br /> I was unfortunately unable to do anything this year, but who cares? AR is dead. LoL~!!
