From <a target="_blank" href="http://gamemusic4all.blogspot.com/2009/01/womengamerscom-interviews-women-from.html">GM4A</a>:

<div class="quoted-text">
  Recently the people over at <a href="http://womengamers.com/">WomenGamers.com</a><br /> took the time to interview three of the female musicians of the OCReMix<br /> world. The article talks to three amazing and talented musicians,<br /> including Jillian Goldin, Nicole Adams, and Elaine Li of Florida based<br /> group Select Start. They cover topics including women in gaming, women in music, the<br /> validity of game music and where VGM is heading in the future.

  They all<br /> provide interesting and thoughtful answers on the questions and it<br /> makes for a really in depth read for those who want to learn more about<br /> these amazing and talented people.

Interestingly enough <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/injury/">OverClocked ReMix&#8217;s <em>very first</em> female ReMixer, injury</a>, wasn&#8217;t mentioned anywhere in the article despite working on a for of the Nicole Adams songs mentioned. Still, it&#8217;s a good read. Check it out.
