For anyone who&#8217;s been wondering (much like I have been) when Shael was going to release his remastered version of Toybox, we regret to inform you that the re-release has been cancelled.
  
From the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=73541" target="_blank">thread @ OCReMix</a>:

_<span class="postbody">&#8220;No longer have accesss to a CD printer; jewel<br /> cases were mistakenly sent back to the company and are no longer<br /> available. CD version of Toybox is canceled. </p> 

<p>
  Better luck next time. :[&#8220;
