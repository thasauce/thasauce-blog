[Nerdapalooza](http://nerdapalooza.org) has just announced the host of this years event, as well as the discount rates available for attendees staying at the venue, the Orlando Airport Marriott.

Nerdapalooza is an annual nerd music concert. This year the festival will be returning to the Orlando Airport Marriott beautiful Orlando, Florida on July 16th and 17th. This places the showÂ convenientlyÂ during the summer in Florida (as if you needed another excuse to go to Florida this summer!), in the city that is also home to Walt Disney World Resort, Universal Studios Orlando Florida, Universal Studios&#8217; Island of Adventure featuring the NEW Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Sea World Orlando, 1000 malls, and MUCH more. This year they will also be returning to the Orlando Airport Marriott that is located [right outside of the Orlando International Airport (MCO)](http://www.orlandoairports.net/). ([For a list of airlines that fly into MCO, check here!](http://www.orlandoairports.net/ops/airlines.htm)) Anyone planning to attend the event will have absolutely no trouble finding a shuttle to bring you the less-than-5-minute trip from the airport to the venue!

This year the Marriott if offering a discount rate of just **$89/night.** Not only that, butÂ **the first 100 to reserve with the Nerdapalooza discount at the Orlando Airport Marriott will receive a 10% discount to the hotelâ€™s restaurant for one meal at their stay!** So if you&#8217;re thinking about going to Nerdapalooza, there&#8217;s no better time to reserve a room than **right now**.

In order to take advantage of this, youâ€™ll have two paths you can take:

  * Either callÂ **407-851-9000** or their toll-free number ofÂ **1-800-380-6751** andÂ **ask for 5th Annual Nerdapalooza Group Block**.
  * **Reserve online atÂ <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mcoap-orlando-airport-marriott/?toDate=&groupCode=nernera&fromDate=&app=resvlink">this link</a>**, which will automatically take you to the Orlando Airport Marriott website with the discount code ofÂ **nernera** entered as the discount code.

Additionally, this year&#8217;s Nerdapalooza will be hosted by none of other thanÂ <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.epicwinburlesque.com/">Epic Win Burlesque</a>. Anyone who attended last years event surely won&#8217;t forget the Epic Win Burlesque performance after-hoursÂ on Saturday evening. For those who didn&#8217;t attend Epic Win Burlesque isÂ a phenomenal burlesque troupe with a taste quite nerdy, as seen in shows themed inÂ _Ghostbusters_, cartoons, and even hosting a debate betweenÂ _Star Trek_ andÂ _Star Wars_. Hosted by [SchÃ¤ffer the Darklord](http://www.schafferthedarklord.com/) andÂ <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nelsonlugo.com/home.html">Nelson Lugo</a>, accomplished magician and vaudevillian, Epic Win has been redefining the craft in New York.

Each year Nerdapalooza grows **bigger and better**, and this year is **no exception!** People from all over the video game remix community are already [lining up to get to Nerdapalooza](http://ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=27256), including [everyone&#8217;s favorite OverClocked After Dark hosts, Level99 and Brushfire](http://lemonsinseries.com/ocrab/).
