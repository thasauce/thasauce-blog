So I was checking out the [VGMix](http://www.vgmix.com) RSS feed, when I had saw that [zyko](http://www.vgmix.com/users?zyko) had released a song call &#8216;[marblez in your mouf](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=4105).&#8217;
  
Well a name like that does tend to spark some interest, and I&#8217;m a
  
pretty big zyko fan as it is, so I decided to head over there and check
  
it out.
  
Turns out &#8216;marblez in your mouf&#8217; is an arrangement of Marble Garden Zone from [Sonic the Hedgehog](http://www.vgmix.com/search.php?game_name=Sonic+the+Hedgehog) and is a follow up to zyko&#8217;s Green Hill arrangement, &#8216;[The Green Hills of East Bay](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=4004)&#8216;, from back in April.

As with most zyko songs, it&#8217;s not exactly easy to explain. It a pretty
  
smoothed out, roughed up, chilled, tossed, and saut?d, all in 1
  
package. However, no matter what you call it, it&#8217;s awesome. Granted it
  
might not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea, but if you like the original, or
  
are familiar with/enjoy zyko&#8217;s other tracks, then you should be able to
  
appreciate this one. 

While there I also decided to pick up another zyko track that was
  
actually a lot older (October 30th, 2004), but I had never seen before.
  
The song is called &#8216;[Of Futility and Hope](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=2611)&#8216; and is an arrangement of the ever-so-popular Tristram music from Diablo & Diablo 2. As this song is _pretty_ effing old, I won&#8217;t go on to really talk about it beyond saying it&#8217;s about 13 minutes of rock solid win.

Another thing I noticed on the RSS feed was that yesterday [EonBlue](http://www.vgmix.com/users?EonBlue) had released his [OverClocked ReMix Idol](http://www.zerodivision.net/idol/) round 1 submission, &#8216;[Mild Psychosis](http://www.vgmix.com/song_view.php?song_id=3926)&#8216;,
  
to VGMix. It&#8217;s a remix of Shademan&#8217;s music from Megaman 7 (which I
  
haven&#8217;t played because I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Megaman games) and it was
  
DEFINITELY one of my favorite tracks in the first round. If you haven&#8217;t
  
heard it yet, it&#8217;s worth listening to, even if you&#8217;ve never heard the
  
source music like I hadn&#8217;t until the actual competition.
