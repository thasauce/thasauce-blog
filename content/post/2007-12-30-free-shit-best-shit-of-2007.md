Not much free shit released lately, save for kahvi which has a shitton of new Christmas releases &#8211; <a href="http://kahvi.org/" target="_blank">check it out!</a>

Hokay guys, 2007 is pretty much over, and what free shit did we come up with this year? Well, it&#8217;s been a great year for free shit, lots of releases&#8230; let&#8217;s take a look back some of my favourite releases from artists and netlabels this year.

This one&#8217;ll chill you down for sure. Kind of comical chill rock EP, encoded at 20kbps of course, which actually makes a pretty cool sound. Makes me nostalgic actually.

<a href="http://www.camomillemusic.com/cam100.htm" target="_blank">Camomille #100 &#8211; Cycles</a>  
a release by the netlabel &#8220;Camomille&#8221; featuring an amazing amount of talent in the internet electronic music scene, and rivals the scope of OCR&#8217;s &#8220;Voices of the Lifestream&#8221; project. Don&#8217;t pass this one up.

<span class="copy">release #209: <a href="http://kahvi.org/143.php">music for a nightmare</a> by various artists<br />Another creepy release, featuring names like Alexander Chereshnev and Saul Stokes. This is great to listen to while playing a game, like Doom or STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl.</span> Cool soundtrackey material and the most notable release [in my opinion] from Kahvi this year.  
<span class="copy"><br />release #207: <a href="http://kahvi.org/141.php"><strong>hringur</strong></a> by nagz<br />Short but sweet, this is another memorable one when I think of Kahvi in 2007. Great sounds and unique style.</p> 

<p>
  </span><span class="copy">release #221: <a href="http://kahvi.org/155.php"><strong>in riots of color they spin</strong></a> by mikael fyrek<br />What can I say? Mikael makes some really cool shit. These are some of my favourite Fyrek tracks. The chick on the CD cover is kind of hot too.</p> 
  
  <p>
    </span><span class="copy">release #211: <a href="http://kahvi.org/145.php"><strong>cdr#2</strong></a> by lackluster<br />This is actually a bunch of really old songs, but Esa [distance/lackluster] released it for free via Kahvi this year back in April. I should mention that this is some of the best chillout IDM ever, though you&#8217;ll either love it or hate it, probably.<br /></span><span class="copy">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

      This is actually one of my favourites of the whole year, not just stuff off monotonik. High quality synthpop with a pretty orchestral/electronic song at the end. Another short and sweet release and definitely memorable [for years to come]. I dunno how he does it. I dunno if he does either, but oh well!

      Quirky music for hyper maniacs. I love it. Cute, fun, fast paced and most importantly CRAZY melodies. Aleksi Eeben AKA Heatbeat is one of my favourite artists ever for this reason.

This one stylistically goes all over the<br /> place as it features everything from crazy drill n bass to hip hop. I<br /> enjoyed the whole thing and you&#8217;ll probably at least like 1 or 2 things<br /> on there.
