Andrew Aversa, better known around these parts as zircon, has taken ill. This case of appendicitis has particularly bad timing; he will be unable to attend the Video Games Live meetup in Washington, DC. Various members of the community have taken it upon themselves to prepare a big ecard in an effort to cheer him up.

_How can you help? Submit your signature in handy PNG, BMP or GIF format **with a white or transparent background** to [zirconcard@gmail.com](mailto://zirconcard@gmail.com/)
  
and get other community members to send in theirs too. Your signature can be pretty much whatever you want it to be, and you can also include a little personal message. The end result will be compiled into one big card.</p> 

Discuss the situation <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=10473" target="_self">here</a>, or in the room #andycard on irc.enterthegame.com
  
Also, noon EST (Friday) is the deadline if you want in on this.</em>
