From <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/wtf/its-national-video-games-day-apparently-299076.php" target="_blank">kotaku</a>:  
_  
&#8220;Happy National Video Games Day! I know you&#8217;ve all been eagerly awaiting
  
this day, reserving a day off of work or school to spend a lazy
  
afternoon participating in our favorite hobby. I am sure you&#8217;ve got
  
some massive parties planned, so be sure to send us photos of how you
  
celebrate the holiday with your friends and loved ones! Yeah, we had no
  
idea either, but Holiday Insights and [American Greetings](http://www.americangreetings.com/ecards/display.pd?bfrom=1&prodnum=2034686&Searchstr=video%20games&path=31871&st=t) indicate that September 12th is NVGD. You&#8217;d think someone would have mentioned it to us.&#8221;_

That&#8217;s the blurb from Holiday Insights, which
  
goes on to state that they have no record of the origin of the holiday
  
or that indeed it even exists. Whatever. American Greetings needs gamer
  
money too you know.
