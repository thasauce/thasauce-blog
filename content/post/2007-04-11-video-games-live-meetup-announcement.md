This was just posted on OverClocked ReMix not too long ago today by <a href="http://www.biggiantcircles.com/" target="_blank">big giant circles</a>. A meetup for the Washington DC Video Games Live concert, on June 29th and 30th, is being put together as we speak. According to Liontamer, there are group ticket sales for 20 or more in a group. If you are able to attend this meetup, post in the thread over at OCR&#8217;s Community Forums by following this <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=8940" target="_blank">link</a>.
