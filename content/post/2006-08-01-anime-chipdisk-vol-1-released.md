  <span class="postbody">Finally, the day we&#8217;ve all been waiting for! CHIPDISK DAY! I decided to<br /> release it a day earlier here though since Anime ReMix is awesome.<br /> There&#8217;s also a humblefool.net/music/ thread since they&#8217;re cool too.<br /> Coda, Tenemis and Nobuyuki helped me out immensely and I couldn&#8217;t have<br /> done it without them.<br /> </span><br /><span class="postbody"></p>

      <span class="postbody">This is a sizable collection of small, loopable chiptunes of<br /> popular anime OP themes, complete with its own player so you don&#8217;t have<br /> to download XMPlay or the winamp BASS plugin or anything. You can also<br /> fit the entire thing uncompressed onto a single floppy disk and play it on any computer! I will copy my writeup from the NFO:<br /> </span><br /><span class="postbody"></p>

              Welcome to the first collection of awesome<br /> <br /> anime chips! Hopefully public interest<br /> <br /> will push us to make another one.<br /> <br /> Feel free to send me requests!<br /> <br /> For this chipdisk I decided to cover OP<br /> <br /> themes from the most popular anime,<br /> <br /> though Tenemis wanted his<br /> <br /> Azuki-chan ending to be used.<br /> <br /> This is okay!<br /> <br /> If another anime chipdisk is created, I<br /> <br /> may focus on BGM or ending themes.</p>

                You may notice some of the songs are a lot<br /> <br /> different than the original. Especially<br /> <br /> those awful OverCoat tracks! Well, changes<br /> <br /> happen when you compress something down to<br /> <br /> 4 channels. There are also some things I<br /> <br /> just can&#8217;t track. At least the melody is<br /> <br /> still intact.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Don&#8217;t forget to turn looping on ðŸ™‚<br /> <br /> a lot of the songs take advantage<br /> <br /> of song looping, and will flow<br /> <br /> better if this is on.
