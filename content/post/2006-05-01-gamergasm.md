[McVaffe](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/mcvaffe/) (and [company](http://www.gamergasm.com/crewmain.htm)) has launched a new humor/satire based video game website called [GamerGasm](http://www.gamergasm.com/). McVaffe had this to say:

&#8220;_GAMERGASM is basically a game-focused humor / opinion sattire site, but using video and audio more than the text or static images in other websites. We&#8217;re also intentionally being rather abrasive and explicit in some of our the segments, for the reasons that (a) it sometimes adds to the humor, and (b) a lot of game information and humor on other sites out there are rather on the conservative side, and we wanted to lighten it up, so to speak&#8230;_&#8220;
