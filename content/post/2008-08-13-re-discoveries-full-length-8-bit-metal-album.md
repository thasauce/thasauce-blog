08/08/08
  
marks the release of _RE: Discoveries_,
  
the first full-length album from the 8-Bit Metal project. One part heavy/power
  
metal and one part chiptune, the 8-Bit Metal sound fuses electric guitars and
  
sounds from the Nintendo Entertainment System to render original music and
  
lyrics centered on classic video games from all eras. This one-man project is
  
manned by an hobbyist musician and distributed freely as downloadable content
  
on the project&#8217;s website. <<http://www.le-ludophile.com/melomania.htm>>
