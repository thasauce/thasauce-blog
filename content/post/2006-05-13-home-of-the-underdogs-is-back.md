<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dafastlane.net"></a>One of the biggest abandonware sites on the internet (Home of the Underdogs) is now back up online and fully functional once again. The site which was down from March 21st 2006 until April 23rd 2006 due to problems with re-registering the domain name now has a new domain for the time being. You can visit it here&#8230;

Negotiations over the previous .org domain it once held are still underway.
