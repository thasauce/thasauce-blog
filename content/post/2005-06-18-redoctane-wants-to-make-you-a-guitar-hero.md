[RedOctane](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Company&search=RedOctane)
  
announced recently that they will be holding a special contest titled
  
&#8220;Be A Guitar Hero,&#8221; for a very unique prize. The winner of this contest
  
will have their song included in the actual [_Guitar Hero_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Guitar%20Hero)
  
game. What better way to help jumpstart your band than have your song
  
be in a bemani game alongside The Red Hot Chili Peppers, David Bowie,
  
and White Zombie? I sure can&#8217;t think of one!
