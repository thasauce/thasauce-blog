I almost don&#8217;t want to write this story. The rumor that [NiGHTS](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=NiGHTS)
  
is going to be reborn on the Wii has been going since before the Wii
  
was even called Wii. But there is now at least one nugget of
  
significant evidence that it may be happening. [Go Nintendo](http://gonintendo.com/?p=14685)
  
posted some scans of Official Nintendo Magazine that mention a &#8220;world
  
exclusive&#8221; scoop on the rebirth of a classic franchise. The picture in
  
the scan shows the stars, clearly outlining&#8230;something._

So Testicular Sound Express at NeoGAF (no relation) put together the scan with the cover art of _NiGHTS_ to produce the following image. You decide for yourself.
