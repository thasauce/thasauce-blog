</center>We just got our hands on London-based 

[Sabrina Valenzuela](http://www.youtube.com/user/SabrinaValenzuela)'sÂ  adorable [cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoVaFzFHbFA&feature=channel_video_title) of Utada Hikaru's â€œSimple and Cleanâ€ with a wonderful accompaniment from YouTube pianist, [Alex Peniera](http://www.youtube.com/alexpeniera). As a self-declared video game fan, Sabrina's skill as a vocalist shines through, carefully integrating sentimental emotion and passion into one of Square Enix's [most popular theme songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikari_%28song%29).Â  Valenzuela has explicitly utilized her YouTube channel as a means of working to â€œbecome a better singer and songwriterâ€. However, we definitely have to applaud this lovely twenty-one year old YouTube songstress on her absolutely gorgeous voice and continued journey as a soloist.

Peep Sabrina Valenzuela's latest video on top. While her VGM-related songs mostly involve Final Fantasy content, check out her YouTube channel [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/SabrinaValenzuela) for more cute video game covers.

P.S. We've been thinking about implementing a â€˜Quick Look' series with videos and featured songs to ThaSauce to introduce emerging artists and musical twists within the VGM scene. While we're also on this topic, I want to know what readers would like to see more of. What do you guys think?
