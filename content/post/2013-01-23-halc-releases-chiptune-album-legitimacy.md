The last time we talked about him, we were announcing [pre-orders for halc&#8217;s Pixel Perfect](http://thasauce.net/2012/05/31/pre-orders-available-for-halcs-pixel-perfect-complete/ "Pre-orders Available for halc's Pixel Perfect Complete"). And, now, we&#8217;re announcing his newest album!

This time, though, it&#8217;s no whistles, no bells, no effects &#8212; just pure chiptune goodness. This is his latest effort, _Legitimacy_. About his goal to create a true chiptune album, he says.

> I&#8217;m proud to finally present my first true chip album, &#8220;Legitimacy&#8221;! This entire EP was composed in MIDI using trash80&#8217;s awesome mGB interface, and recorded line out from a single prosound DMG Game Boy with no external EQ or effects.

A chiptune/electronic composer and arranger, halc is also the founder of <a title="9-bit Records" href="http://9bitrecords.com" target="_blank">9-bit Records</a>, a non-profit netlabel for electronic music.
