This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):
  
Not-so-super heros Rayman and Pixalilin are forced to do a Russian
  
Roulette Re-Roll (RRRR), the VGDJ voicemails are getting weirder and
  
weirder, and our hosts are missing some serious pants &#8212; not to mention
  
Rama Lama&#8217;s ding-dong! Hopefully Aurora can set things right next week.
  
Until then, enjoy the ride!
