This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):
  
Rayza has recently suffered some emotionally damaging &#8220;hardware
  
malfunctions,&#8221; hence the absence of last week&#8217;s episode. Everyone pay
  
him your condolences. Anyway, we&#8217;re back in action&#8230; and how! Upcoming
  
meet-ups, Mazedude&#8217;s new remix album, some major changes in the judges
  
panel, and a little crush talk just for you.
