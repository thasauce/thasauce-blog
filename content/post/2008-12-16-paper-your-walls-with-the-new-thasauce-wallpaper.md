I&#8217;ve had the new logo sitting around for awhile, and while I still can&#8217;t afford to get those new shirts printed, I decided I&#8217;d make some wallpapers.

You can download the whole pack here:

I also included a PSD template so you can make around with it and customize it for yourself.
