No big descriptions tonight, had 3 hours of sleep last night and must rest soon

_<a href="http://20kbps.sofapause.ch/Releases/c4_-_nuclear_love_powerhouse-(20k226)-2007.zip" target="_self">c4_-_nuclear_love_powerhouse-(20k226)-2007</a>. highly caffienated electronic music artist c4 (<a href="http://www.proc-records.net/" target="_blank">proc-records</a>)
  
drives us crazy with his second release, nuclear love powerhouse! it
  
features two fabulous breakbeat-techno and a very nice ambient track.
  
you&#8217;re on the planet!_ [soc note: this is released on the 20kbps Netlabel. It is supposed to sound like that]

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono211.com/content/releases/mtkmp193.html">Ocbalt &#8211; As Is EP</a>  
_&#8220;A debut on Monotonik, then, for Finland-based electronic music artist
  
Ocbalt, with some delightfully bubble, vocoded tracks from his upcoming
  
&#8216;Vintage Art&#8217; album. </p> 

The full album should be out on a physical label pretty soon, but we,
  
luckily enough, get a digital EP to precede it, with the brief spoken
  
word &#8216;What Is Art?&#8217; seguing swiftly into the surprising bleep-pop of
  
&#8216;Bribe&#8217;, which showcases sweet multi-tracked vocoded singing and
  
super-catchy synths, all stutter-step.

The other two tracks are dead-on, too, with &#8216;As Is&#8217; blasting a
  
little tarantella on drums before spooky synths wander in and looped
  
spaceman vocals wander across the top somewhere or other. Finally,
  
&#8216;Okno&#8217; has an odd spoken word loop to start out before some absolutely
  
delightful idmpop wanders into view, catchy and smart. &#8216;Ok yes&#8217;, Ocbalt
  
&#8211; and thanks for sharing with us.&#8221;
