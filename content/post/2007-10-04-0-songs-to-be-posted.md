Seriously people. I have 1 song that needs to be resubmitted because of the server swap, 1 song to be QC&#8217;d, and nothing else. I can&#8217;t post more songs if I don&#8217;t HAVE more songs.

If you submitted a song and I lost it&#8230;resubmit it.

If you made a song and didn&#8217;t submit it&#8230;submit it.

If you&#8217;re thinking making a song and maybe submitting it&#8230;submit it.

If you already submitted it to OCR&#8230;submit it.

If you know a cool song that isn&#8217;t on OCR&#8230;contact the artist and have them submit it.

Seriously people.
