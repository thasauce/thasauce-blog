In response to some new e-mails I&#8217;ve gotten, I added information on the [news feed](backend.php), as well as information on how to add it as a Live Bookmark in Firefox, to the [FAQ section](modules.php?name=FAQ&myfaq=yes&id_cat=1&categories=ThaSauce). Anyone with any other suggestions should comment here or use the [Feedback / Bugs module](modules.php?name=Feedback).

It has also come to my attention, after a few queries about it, that [VGMix](http://www.vgmix.com)
  
no longer has the link to THEIR news feed, which is displayed here,
  
availible on their mainpage. The VGMix news feed is avalible @ <http://www.vgmix.com/rss/releases.php>
