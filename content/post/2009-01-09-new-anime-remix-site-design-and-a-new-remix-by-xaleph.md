<span class="description">What <a href="http://www.animeremix.org/animix_forums/viewtopic.php?id=2131" target="_blank">I said over there:</a></p> 

<div class="quoted-text">
  WE&#8217;LL<br /> DO IT LIVE! We did a LOT of testing with this new version of the site,<br /> to iron out all the big bugs, but there&#8217;s likely a few left just from<br /> carrying this new design over. If you find anything wrong or if you&#8217;d<br /> like to give feedback on the design, let Xaleph know [because that&#8217;s<br /> not my job :D]. Well I think it&#8217;s great, the black and brownish greens<br /> were getting depressing. All those headers <span class="details">everyone<br /> worked on are now gone but I hope anyone didn&#8217;t work TOO hard on those.<br /> Perhaps we&#8217;ll enlist everyone&#8217;s help on making new site headers this<br /> time too! AAAAAAAAnyway, welcome to the new site.</p>
