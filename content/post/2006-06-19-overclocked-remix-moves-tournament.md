From <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86185" target="_blank">the thread @ OCR</a>:

<span class="postbody"><br /> Ok, so I had the idea earlier today to hold a Moves tournament. Since<br /> there&#8217;s not too many people that play, this first one is pbrbobablby<br /> going to be small, but hopefully will build interest.<br /> </span>
  
<span class="postbody">Format:</p> 

<p>
  The tournament will be divided into two stages: A pool stage and a<br /> bracket stage. Unless there&#8217;s a lot more people playing than I think,<br /> the bracket stage will be 3 rounds, single elimination (8 slots). There<br /> will be two pools (called &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; for simplicity), and 4 people<br /> will advance to the bracket stage from each.
</p>

<p>
  The pool stages will be round-robin, i.e. each person plays each<br /> other person in the group. For fairness, each pairing will play TWO<br /> matches, each person going first in one match. Points will be awarded<br /> as follows:
</p>

<p>
  -Win a match: 10 points.<br /> <br /> -Each pawn remaining: 1 point.<br /> <br /> -King remaining: 2 points.
</p>

<p>
  This means everyone will get at least two points per match. The 4<br /> people with the most points in each pool will advance to the bracket<br /> stage.
</p>

<p>
  The bracket stage will be a best-of-5 series in each round, with<br /> the higher seed choosing who goes first in the first match, and then<br /> alternating from there. (In the event of &#8220;tied&#8221; seeds, which is<br /> possible due to drawing from two pools, the person with the highest<br /> number of points in the bracket stage is considered to be the higher<br /> seed; if this is tied, then the total non-win points is considered; if<br /> it&#8217;s still tied, it&#8217;ll be a coin flip.)
</p>

<p>
  The finals of the bracket stage will be a best-of-7 series instead of a best-of-5.
