<span class="postbody">It&#8217;s that time again. Time for&#8230; </p> 

<p>
  ANIME REMIX HALLOWEEN COMPETITION 2K5!
</p>

<p>
  The objective, of course, is to complete a song by Halloween! The rules are mostly the same as last time, and they are, as follows:</span><br /> <span class="postbody">-Complete one song by midnight, October 31st GMT [Grenich Mean Time, to be absolutely fair to everyone] and send it through any means necessary to the leader of the competition. </p> 
  
  <p>
    -The song must be from an animated series, movie, or video. This is more clearly defined in the Anime ReMix site FAQ, which explains what is and what isn&#8217;t allowed here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    -The song must have &#8220;halloween elements.&#8221; Scariness, spookiness, craziness. For further definition, ask the project leader for specifics.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    -Songs which are late will not be allowed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    -In the event of only one submission, the one contestant wins by default.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    -After all the submissions are in, the rest of the community can e-mail or use a forum PM to relay their choice for best song.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    -Have fun! [obligatory cheesy rule]
  </p>
