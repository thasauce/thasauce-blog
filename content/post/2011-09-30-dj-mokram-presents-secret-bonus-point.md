</center>Yeah, yeah. We know that we&#8217;ve been dropping the ball lately. Blame it on delicious, tasty beer and the

 _Ico/SOTC_ Collection drop (it&#8217;s great!). But that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t care about the arrangement community! We just received word that ThaSauce alum [Dj Mokram](http://remix.thasauce.net/mixer/djmokram/), has recently released a free album:

> Dj Mokram, in association with Nitro Game Injection ([http://kngi.org](http://kngi.org/)), is proud to announce the release of Dynamite Headdy: Secret Bonus Point.
> 
> Secret Bonus Point is a tribute album to Dynamite Headdy, a sidescroller-platforming/shooting game developed by Treasure Co. Ltd. and published by SEGA for the Genesis/Mega Drive in 1994. Featuring 26 arrangements in a variety of styles by 14 artists, SBP pays homage to the soundtrack composed by NazoÂ² Unit (Katsuhiko Suzuki, Norio Hanzawa, Aki Hata, Koji Yamada and Yasuko). The album is divided into 4 chapters, reenacting the story of Headdy and his friends, fighting for their beliefs against the evil Dark Demon King, in order to save the Puppet Kingdom from its oppressive ruler.
> 
> Secret Bonus Point was born as a response to this remix request. You can learn more about it and download the album for free at: http://dhsbp.kngi.org.

With a quick listen and garnered feedback, we have a sneaking suspicion that _Secret Bonus Point_ is pretty epic. Peep the trailer above or [head over here](http://dhsbp.kngi.org/) for more information on Dj Mokram&#8217;s fantastic project. Give it a try if you daaaaare.
