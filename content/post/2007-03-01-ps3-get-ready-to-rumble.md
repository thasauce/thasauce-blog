A year ago, it seemed that DualShock, the vibrating technology in Sony&#8217;s console controllers, [wouldn&#8217;t be seen again](modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=252). That may not be the case anymore.

<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070301/sfth075.html?.v=79" target="_blank">In an announcement today</a>, Sony and Immersion Corp. (which holds the patents to the type of rumble technology used in the PS2&#8217;s and XBOX&#8217;s controllers) have wrapped up their patent infringement case and have entered into a deal for Sony to licence the technology.

This is potentially good news for Sony, as [recent developments](modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=563) make the PS3 less desirable in the long run. While there is no set timetable for introducing rumble to the PS3, it is coming, and could be a much-needed boost to the last-place console. (In January, the top-selling consoles were, in order, the Wii, PS2, XBOX360, and PS3.)
