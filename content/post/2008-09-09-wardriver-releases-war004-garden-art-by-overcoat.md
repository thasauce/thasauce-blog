Wardriver is pleased to announce the release of our fourth official album, <a href="http://wardriver.thasauce.net/release/war004" target="_blank">Garden Art</a>. <a href="http://wardriver.thasauce.net/artist/2" target="_blank">OverCoat</a>&#8216;s second Wardriver release is fourteen tracks of lo-fi/ambient weirdness, with obligatory cameos by <a href="http://wardriver.thasauce.net/artist/5" target="_blank">Skrypnyk</a> and <a href="http://wardriver.thasauce.net/artist/14" target="_blank">Hollowtone</a>. Though it was <a href="news/664" target="_blank">originally released</a> by OverCoat back in August 2007, Garden Art now officially has a home on Wardriver, so be sure to give it a listen.
