So I was poking around the internet today, looking to check up on some of my favorite remixer&#8217;s original works, and I noticed something over at <a target="_blank" href="http://shaelbopp.livejournal.com/">Shael&#8217;s LiveJournal</a>.
  
Apparently the man has just recently released a NEW CD entitled, &#8220;**Silly Puppy: Songs From the Film P. Rappa&#8217;s Nth Mile**.&#8221; (an obvious reference <a target="_blank" href="www.x-strikestudios.com/parappa.html">to the X-Strike Studio&#8217;s film</a>.) I&#8217;ve listened to a number of the tracks and I must say, like ALL Shael Riley songs, this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 

Check it out here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shaelriley.com/sillypuppy">http://www.shaelriley.com/sillypuppy</a>

Also be sure to check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shaelriley.com">Shael&#8217;s new front page</a> (which has had a nice update), and a new single, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://lobachevsky.homelinux.net/%7Esriley/Original/Shael%20Riley%20-%20Wall.mp3">Wall</a>.&#8221;
