    n00b &#8211; &#8220;HEy SnapPleMan, wuts PUCHFEST?&#8221;<br /> snappleman &#8211; &#8220;PUNCHFEST is a<br /> 6 hour remix competition which takes place in an IRC chat room. You are<br /> given a theme, and you must complete a song within the 6 hour time<br /> limit. You will be given the theme early in the week, (PUNCHFESTs will<br /> usually take place on a Saturday or Sunday) so that this way you can<br /> pick a song and learn it before the day of the competition. You can&#8217;t<br /> work on it before the compo officially starts. We&#8217;re using the honor<br /> system here. Read the rules for more details.&#8221;</div>

        I<br /> figured I&#8217;d give you guys an extra day with this weeks theme because<br /> you&#8217;ll need to listen intently to these songs. There is no method of<br /> seperating the channels for these soundtracks (that I know of at<br /> least).

        THEME RESTRICTIONS &#8211; You can&#8217;t do TMNT, Gradius,<br /> Lifeforce/Salamander games, and you can&#8217;t do any game released post<br /> 1998. Choose a game that meets these criteria from the list below, and<br /> use BridgeM1 player to listen to the music from the rom.

        This<br /> music is more layered and harder to transcribe than the console stuff,<br /> so you really should take the extra time to learn a song so you can<br /> perform/record it on Saturday.

Just make<br /> sure you submit an MP3 file of whatever it is you did.<br /> &#8211; No minimum song length requirement.<br /> &#8211; Submission is not anonymous!
