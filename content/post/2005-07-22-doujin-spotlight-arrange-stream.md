<div>
  The Japanese remix site <a href="http://music.readalittle.net/" target="_blank">Arrange Stream</a> recently resumed its normal operation with the triumphant words &#8220;job hunt ended.&#8221;</p> 
  
  <p>
    Babelfish warning, as usual.

</div>

Arrange Stream keeps track of video game arrangements and originals from dozens of websites, such as <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/" target="_blank">OCR</a> and <a href="http://www.vgmix.com/" target="_self">VGMix,</a> and posts the newest songs as they are released. Even tracks from <a href="http://www.starblast.org/" target="_self">Starblast.org</a> and <a href="http://www.darkesword.com/" target="_blank">Darkesword.com</a>
  
have been known to show up once in a while. It&#8217;s a great way to stay up
  
to date with the Japanese remix scene, as well as get acquainted with
  
lots of great doujin music you otherwise would never have known about.

Highly recommended!
