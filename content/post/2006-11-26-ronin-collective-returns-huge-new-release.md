_&#8220;Ronin Collective is back! With a new website,
        
a new compilation and new resident artists! Check it out!_

<div align="justify">
  <em>&#8220;After more than 2 years of inactivity,<br /> Ronin Collective is back, and we wanted to do a special release for our<br /> return. Gama, a 24 track, 2hour compilation featuring Ronin members, guests<br /> and friends perfectly defining the eclecticism behind the Ronin style. You&#8217;ll<br /> find everything ronin has been and more; returning members deliver yet again<br /> with a periphery of tones and styles from Blisaed&#8217;s guitar-hop, to Wiseman&#8217;s<br /> folk-psychadelia, to Benefit of the Boomerang&#8217;s flaming jungle and V0idnull&#8217;s<br /> goa epic. Also, two new official members to Ronin: recent guest-releaser<br /> Fah offers two incredible tracks, a 12 minute acid track and a gorgeous<br /> cinematic forray into analog ambient as outro to our comp, and Troupe, with<br /> a delicate indie-tronic track. Last, we also have a few great guests on<br /> the compil, including Nagz with his enchanting demo-breaks, Le Monsieur<br /> Baguette&#8217;s naive melodies and glitchy love, Kevin Chow&#8217;s orchestral masterpiece,<br /> Beatslaughter&#8217;s two contributions to the world of breakbeat and everything<br /> in between. Ranging from ambient, to hip-hop, through idm and to harsh noise,<br /> this compilation is a manifesto to our ideologies of creativity and individuality.&#8221;</em><br /><em><br /><em><a target="_blank" href="http://ronin.genshimedia.com/025.htm">Here is a direct link to the release&#8217;s page</a>.
