  CompoST 62 happened today! The theme was &#8220;dogfight,&#8221; so in this one we had to create a song for a high-energy, high-tension duel! CompoSTers were: Myself, Skrypnyk, MagiNinja, vindkast, and djcubez. Lots of compo virgins today, you can <em>almost smell the cherry blood</em>. Anyway, here are the songs:<br /><a href="http://compost.lggaming.com/compost62/">http://compost.lggaming.com/compost62/</a></p>

    Skrypnyk&#8217;s was the most liked out of everyone&#8217;s. Good job Skrypnyk!
