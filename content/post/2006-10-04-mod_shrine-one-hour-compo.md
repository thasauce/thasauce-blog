Tuesday evening I hosted a one hour tracking compo on the #mod_shrine
  
channel, on esper.net! The samples were mostly in tune, only off
  
by a few cents for the most part, but that didn&#8217;t stop these guys from
  
putting on a good show.
  
What follows is the results as I posted them in the channel.
  
Bolded items are artists and their corresponding songs, underline is
  
the number of points they received.
