<img border="0" align="right" src="http://h.xerol.org/i/ipod.png" title="Yours, for free!" alt="Yours, for free!" />From the album that soc himself describes as the ideal starting point for &#8220;the OverCoat sound&#8221; comes a track that&#8230;defies description. I think you should just listen.

  * Download the song: [Free Shit](featsong/OverCoat%20-%20Today%20is%20a%20Horrible%20Day%20to%20Feel%20Beautiful%20-%2002%20-%20Free%20Shit.mp3)
