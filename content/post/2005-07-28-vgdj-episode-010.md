This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):
  
Aurora & Rayza take you on the road as OCRers from all over the
  
Greater Toronto Area (and Winnipeg and Boston) gather for the 2nd
  
Biannual OCR TORONTO meetup at the shittiest restaurant known to man.
  
Follow us as we bring you the sights and sounds of the local arcade and
  
our eventual baby and ethnic clapping-ridden journey to Centre Island.
