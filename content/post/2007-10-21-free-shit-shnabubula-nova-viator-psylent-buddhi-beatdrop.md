Four! Four items of interest this week!
  
Finally a mention of free music from someone besides me! Another Soundscape writes:  
_<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/shnabubula/">&#8220;Sam &#8216;Shnabubula&#8217; Ascher-Weiss</a> has released many albums of original <span class="highlight">music</span><a target="_blank" href="ahttp://www.arnoldascher.com">ArnoldAscher.com</a>. Here you can find over 7 original albums, some chiptunes and piano
  
performances. A true goldmine. Sam&#8217;s work is highly enjoyable even
  
though it&#8217;s at times very spastic. Creative digital signal processing
  
should be his second name together with jazz. Go get this now! If you&#8217;re stupid and want to try something out before downloading it
  
all I recommend &#8220;She&#8217;s a grammar god&#8221; and &#8220;Community Knowledge&#8221;. Great
  
short albums. in mp3 format over at his webspace&#8221;</p>

<a href="http://www.kahvi.org/157.php" target="_blank">Nova Viator &#8211; Rudi Rudi</a>  
_many moons went by and all of a sudden an apparition appeared on the
  
horizon &#8211; a reinvented &#8216;luke the wizard&#8217; no less, this time around
  
known as Nova Viator. A couple of huge releases suddenly arrived in the
  
inbox. Rudi Rudi is the more unconventional of the two, with 17(!)
  
tracks of uniqueness. I would say the best description of this release
  
is a patchwork of &#8216;shorts&#8217; &#8211; ranging from 40 seconds to 6 minutes long,
  
all painting one bigger picture. All the tracks have something quite
  
epic, interesting and unheard before &#8211; the truly unique and odd to the
  
idm inspired masterpieces. this is the sign of a really nice release,
  
so take a deep breath and listen to the man who calls himself &#8216;Nova
  
Viator&#8217;.</p>

Some nice goa/psytrance, with synthwork reminiscient of The Alpha Conspiracy [<a href="http://kahvi.org/91.php" target="_blank">here</a>] [and <a href="http://kahvi.org/14.php" target="_blank">here</a>] though by and far more straightforward and danceable, enjoyable for other reasons ðŸ™‚

<a href="http://beatdrop.paletteswap.com/Beatdrop%20-%20Get%20Down.mp3" target="_blank">Beatdrop &#8211; Get Down</a>  
THIS IS SHITTY MAINSTREAM DANCE MUSIC. Most of you know who Beatdrop is so I&#8217;ll spare the introduction and just say that he&#8217;s recently released two tracks this past week, both pretty high quality and enjoyable.
