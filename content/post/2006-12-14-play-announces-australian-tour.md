I guess Australia is hot right now, because a day before Passion!&#8217;s Sydney concert, PLAY! has announced that it too will tour Australia beginning June 20 2007 in Sydney. The first concert will be at the Sydney Opera house. It&#8217;s interesting that we now have two big video game orchestral movements making worldwide bids. Anyhow, I&#8217;m in a good position to get a lot of coverage of the Passion! concert taking place this weekend, so expect some neat pictures and possibly some videos and recordings.
