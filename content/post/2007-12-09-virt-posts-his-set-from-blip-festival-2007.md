  Manhattan art space The Tank and New York artist collective 8bitpeoples announce the Blip Festival 2007, a four-day music and multimedia event taking place in New York City November 29 &#8211; December 2, 2007. Focusing on the modern artistic exploration of primitive video game and home computer technology and featuring 40 musicians and visualists from around the world, the Blip Festival showcases artists adopting and repurposing familiar but forgotten hardware &#8211; such as the Commodore 64, the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Atari game console and home computer line, and the Nintendo Game Boy &#8211; exploring their untapped potential and unique aesthetic character.

[Blip Festival 2007](http://www.blipfestival.org/) has come and gone, but the legend shall live on. The event featured [Nullsleep](http://www.nullsleep.com/), [Blasterhead](http://www.blasterhead.com/), and other big names from the modern chiptune scene getting down and dirty in New York&rsquo;s [The Tank](http://www.thetanknyc.org/). On Friday, November 30, one of the performers was [Jake &ldquo;virt&rdquo; Kaufman](http://virt.vgmix.com/), riding the wave of his most recently released game work, [_Contra 4_](http://www.konami-data.com/officialsites/contra4/).

Today, virt [**posted the six songs he played during his set**](http://virt.vgmix.com/?p=77). The set included arrangements of past songs he wrote (including one from a game he scored, [_Shantae_](http://www.shantae.com/)), an arrangement of Jamiroquai&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love Foolosophy,&rdquo; and a few original pieces. Check the video below for a short snippet of his performance of &ldquo;DnB Chip Mix 07&Prime;:



&ldquo;DnB Chip Mix 07&Prime; gets my vote for best track by being an epic nine and a half minutes of FM bliss, but also worth mentioning is &ldquo;Loli Fishing Next 20,000 Leagues,&rdquo; a chiptune arrangement of a [Kwakfest](http://kwakfest.vgmix.com/) piece. Really, though, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with any piece.
