Time to get with what could very well be one of the best releases of 2012! [Open Circuit](http://kngi.org/about/infofaq-open-circuit) will be hosting an online listening party forÂ [Cory Johnson](http://cory.fm/.)&#8216;s finalized version of the long-awaited _The Legend of Zelda_ album tonight at 5 PM EST on [Arecibo Radio](http://areciboradio.com/):

> Originally released as a collection of unpolished demo recordings in August 2011, Cory Johnson&#8217;s post-rock interpretation of the classic Zelda music took the internet by storm, garnering coverage from Destructoid, ScrewAttack, and more.
> 
> On Saturday, May 12th 2012, 5PM eastern, join Open Circuit on Arecibo Radio as we celebrate the long awaited debut of the finalized version of Cory Johnson&#8217;s album The Legend of Zelda.
> 
> This will be the first place to hear the full album which is currently slated to include not only songs from the demo album, but also new arrangements of Gerudo Valley, Outset Island, Tal Tal Heights, and more! After the listening party, the album will be available as a free / pay what you want download hosted on Cory&#8217;s [Bandcamp page](http://coryjohnson.bandcamp.com/).
