</center>Calling all Bay Area residents, 

[the Minibosses](http://www.minibosses.com/) are comin&#8217; at you fast this June! With a broad range of instrumental covers of 8-bit NES songs, the Minibosses will rip into your soul with hard-hitting video game metal. Even still, the Minibosses tend to effectively reconstruct all your old favorites into something every gamer will recognize and enjoy which makes it easy to see why the reality of this band&#8217;s popularity is made quite apparent ([check out](http://minibosses.bandcamp.com/album/brass-2-mouth) their latest releaseÂ _Brass 2: Mouth_ if you haven&#8217;t). And let&#8217;s not get into stage presence. Wait, we will. Being at a Minibosses show can easily be one of the best live performances of your life, simply because these dudes just _get it._ Claiming total ownership over the crowd with the ways they can easily excite fans by playing a specific _CastlevaniaÂ _theme throughout the night just to mess around, the Minibosses are sure to please anyone who has picked up a NES controller.

The Minibosses will embark on what they call a mini-tour, travelling through various locations in the San Francisco Bay Area with their instruments in tow. Peep the dates and locations below:

FRIDAY June 1st, 2012 &#8211; Subzero Fest in San Jose
