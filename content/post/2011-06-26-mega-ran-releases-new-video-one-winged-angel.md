[Surfacing as an update on his Twitter page](http://twitter.com/#!/MegaRan/status/84870134828773376), [Random](http://megaran.com/), also known as **Mega Ran**,Â  has just released a video for his single â€œOne Winged Angelâ€. As a featured performer at the [upcoming nerd festival Nerdapalooza in Orlando, Florida](http://nerdapalooza.org/), Mega Ran has received significant attention as a distinguished rapper and producer. Incorporating masterfully executed lyrics that blends beautifully with visceral beats produced by Storyville, â€œOne Winged Angelâ€ is a powerful retelling of Sephirothâ€™s origin story and his following subsequent rage that threatens to destroy the world. Part of Mega Ranâ€™s highly acclaimed _[Black Materia: Final Fantasy VII](http://random.bandcamp.com/album/black-materia-final-fantasy-vii),_ â€œOne Winged Angelâ€ shows that Mega Ran can still appeal to a broader audience outside of the video game community through his own visceral rhymes that literally knock you off your seat.
