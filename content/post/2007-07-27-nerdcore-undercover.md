Maybe a bit late, like over half a month or something, but IMO still worth posting. A couple of months in the making, now finally released is a Nerdcore Compilation project called &#8220;<a href="http://www.hipsterplease.com/2007/07/nerdcore-undercover.html" target="_blank">Nerdcore Undercover</a>&#8221; by Z from Hipster, please!

Featured on the album are people like YTCracker, myf, Goondocks and Shael Riley with covers from popular artists interpreted in the typical known nerdcore style by the participating artists. The album is free of charge, available in mp3 format and bundled with an awesome comic style cover to wrap up this project.

I&#8217;d say check it out over at <a href="http://www.hipsterplease.com/2007/07/nerdcore-undercover.html" target="_blank">Hipster, please!</a>  
&#8230;and enjoy some nice nerdcore tunes.
