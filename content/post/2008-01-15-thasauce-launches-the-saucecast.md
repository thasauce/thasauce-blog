<img border="0" align="right" src="images/newsMisc/saucecast.png" />Long after VGDJ has ended it&#8217;s run, we&#8217;ve FINALLY gotten around to recording and releasing our own podcast: SauceCast. A bi-weekly podcast chock full of community&#8230;stuff.
  
The website is still under construction, and the shownotes haven&#8217;t been posted yet, but you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Saucecast" target="_blank">subcribe to the RSS feed right now</a>.

Starla and Dyne discuss MAGFest, the new featured content box, and VGMix X among other stuff.

There are a lot of exciting new things I want to do with this podcast, one of them being Chapters for the podcast:  
 <img border="0" src="http://saucecast.thasauce.net/iTunesSauceCast.png" />

When you load the podcast up in iTunes or an iPod it&#8217;s broken into chapters. On the iTunes side it even has clickable links to topics being discussed throughout.

      Alright, so I arrived on Thursday, got acquainted with so many people from the OCR community, of course, from ThaSauce community, a lot of these VGMix, all these guys. And pretty much went straight into the game room, not much was happening on the first day. They had so many games set up, it was phenomenal. Everything from Tetris Attack to Rock Band to Mega Man 2. It was phenomenal the broad range of games that they had set up.

      When I got there Friday night, I was amazed by how cool everything was. I couldn&#8217;t believe how much they had set up. All the games that were there and everything. Wow. It was just amazing to walk in there and see all that. And then I went downstairs and I checked out JamSpace. And that&#8217;s where I met up with a lot of OC Remixers and ThaSauce staff, it was a lot of fun. And there was actually a chiptune concert that night, and that was a lot of fun. I believe that was virt doing the chiptune concert that night. But we&#8217;re still talking about Thursday.

      Because there wasn&#8217;t much going on on Thursday night, we went ahead and headed up to, I don&#8217;t even remember who&#8217;s room, we probably all went our separate ways, and went into different people&#8217;s rooms, but we all partied for sure. About maybe, 1am we headed down to the JamSpace and watch one of the most phenomenal concerts I&#8217;ve ever seen.

      Absolutely. We had that girl playing Zelda on the projector screen, playing the most perfect speed-run I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. That was awesome. And she later on was playing Star Fox and a couple of other games. She was playing Link to the Past, and just doing the most amazing speed-run. Oh, Super Metroid, she was playing Super Metroid too.

      So there&#8217;s actually a little story that Rama gave me about Shnabubula, and a little remix that he made live called &#8220;Terra&#8217;s Got Her Groove Back&#8221;. So I&#8217;m gonna go tell that story right now. And there&#8217;s actually a story that goes here from JamSpace. Okay, here&#8217;s how this story goes: &#8220;it&#8217;s Thursday night, early Friday morning, about 2 or 3 in the morning. Shnab&#8217;s down in JamSpace, owning it as usual. He&#8217;s trying to get Dhsu to play something with him. And Fusion and Rama are down there and they&#8217;re trying to figure out if they should just record some stuff for JamSpace and post it on Remix: ThaSauce. So they say to Shnab, &#8216;Well, hey, play something right now perfect and we&#8217;ll post it on R:TS ASAP.&#8217; So Shnab goes, &#8216;Okay, it&#8217;s gonna be Terra, it&#8217;s gonna be R&B, and it&#8217;s gonna be called &#8220;Terra&#8217;s Got Her Groove Back&#8221;.&#8221;

      And let me tell you, I was completely blown away by this. I couldn&#8217;t even understand, first off, how he had enough hands to play the parts that he was playing, and beyond that to be able to come up with original content. I mean, I could sit here and work for months and months and never come up with anything that phenomenal. So, much love for Sam.

      And we&#8217;ll also be posting that link, along with any links we mention here in the SauceCast, in our show notes. So feel free to check that out. So that wraps up Thursday&rsquo;s coverage. I wasn&#8217;t actually able to be there until Friday. But when I did get there, I got in and I went down to virt&#8217;s chiptune concert. So earlier Friday, virt actually had the VGMix/Kwak panel, and he basically talked about what he does in the gaming industry. How he works, which he works contractually for a number of game companies, writing music, doing all kinds of cool stuff. So, that was a lot of fun for people I&#8217;m sure. And then, let&#8217;s see, what else was there. And if you&#8217;ve ever actually had a chance to listen to any of his Dwelling of Duels music, the man is phenomenal, he has mad skills. Seriously. He really does, he&#8217;s just amazing.

I did Angela from Seiken Densetsu 3, not sure if any of you have played that, but um, unfortunately *starla laughs*, I did win, because there were no other women competing single. There were a couple of groups, and some of the groups did win as well. My trophy stated, &#8220;Thanks for last night. Your mom was great.&#8221;

      Yeah, here&#8217;s hopin&#8217;. *starla laughs* So when you go to OCR, you can actually, DJP actually used Sakuraba as an example. And you can actually search for him using the Japanese kanji in his name. And you&#8217;re going to find his name, birth date, publishers he&#8217;s been with, systems he&#8217;s been featured on musically. You&#8217;re going to find remixes, if there are any on the web site, and by who. You&#8217;re also going to find games. Now, it&#8217;s not a comprehensive list, so, they&#8217;re actually working on that, so don&#8217;t be surprised. Something else that&#8217;s new there is also the link to IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base), actually, it&#8217;s a new thing as well. They&#8217;re with the Internet Movie Data Base now, so you can go right to that. There&#8217;s also Moby Games, Music Brainz and the Wikipedia in English. What else was there?

I&#8217;m sure it is, but, just in case, just letting you know. And Shael Riley was also at MAGFest. He was in JamSpace, and it was great to finally get to see him in person. I&#8217;ve listened to some of his music, I really enjoy it. He actually got up on stage and rocked out with Suzu and Shnab. That was a lot of fun to listen to and watch.

      So, at our panel, there was a question at the OCR Panel about the side bar. A lot of people don&#8217;t like the side bar on OC Remixes&#8217; web site. One thing we discussed at our panel was Styles. And we can go ahead and essentially reskin the whole web site. There&#8217;s a whole mess of them up. I&#8217;m going to give you two links, but we&#8217;re also going to go ahead and link to them in the write up, we&#8217;ve got userstyles.org/users/343. We&#8217;re also going to be building a web page on ocrstyles.thasauce.net. We&#8217;ll go ahead and link that again in the write up here. And, we&#8217;ve got a couple of styles up there. There&#8217;s, most of them are going to have the code in there to get rid of the side bar, but the code is going to be commented out. There is one up there, the OCR3 one, gets rid of it. Now, it did work 100% when we had PHPBB as used on the message boards, however, since it&#8217;s been changed to vbulletin, it&#8217;s only about maybe 90% of the way there, programming wise. There&#8217;s a couple of things here and there, like the colors that aren&#8217;t completely 100% but if you don&#8217;t mind that, and you want to get rid of the side bar, it&#8217;s definitely worth checking out.

You definitely got to check it out, it&#8217;s the featured song this month on ThaSauce, check it out. Let&#8217;s see, another happening, right before MAGFest actually was the return of VGMix X. I know they were supposed to go to VGMix 3, but right before MAGFest, about two days before MAGFest, VGMix X came online, it&#8217;s no long an idle page with forums, it&#8217;s actually now a content management system. And it looks great, they&#8217;re still working on it, a lot of things gotta be done yet. But, you can go there now, check out new songs. Last count, they had about 38 pages worth of songs, there&#8217;s about 15 to 20 a page. Go check it out, I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. Have fun with that. That&#8217;d be vgmix.com. You&#8217;ll have a link on the show notes for that.
