After the unparalled success of <a href="http://downloads.lggaming.com/album5" target="_blank">album5</a>, I&#8217;m heading up a new project: album6. Unlike album5, album6 will be a collaborative album, with each artist submitting one track. All that&#8217;s required is a registered version of FL Studio and 3xOsc presets. The hour-long event will take place from 8-9pm EDT (Midnight-1am GMT) in #album6 on irc.enterthegame.com. Be there, or else you won&#8217;t be there.
