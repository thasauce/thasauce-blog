  OK<br /> Everyone, time for our next compilation! What we are looking for are<br /> any and all songs about the Sega Genesis (or Megadrive, if you will)</p> 
  
  <p>
    Criteria:<br /> 192KBPS or better quality track
  </p>
  
  <p>
    song can be made specifically for this album, or donated from previous work
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I need your email address, and myspace URL if you have one
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remix/Cover<br /> of songs from Sega Genesis games &#8211; Please let me know the game and<br /> original song name so we don&#8217;t have ten covers of the first level of<br /> streets of rage or something
  </p>
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  Songs with Lyrics &#8211; The instrumentation can be a game song remix or original tune, as long as you are singing/rapping about the genesis or a game found on the sega genesis!</p> 
  
  <p>
    Songs are needed by October 1st! And the songs should be well and cleanly recorded, and be awesome!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PS If you are doing a sonic cover, pick something obscure, all the most recognizable ones are taken! Also, I want an SNES diss song somewhere on this compilation!<br /> -Anthony
