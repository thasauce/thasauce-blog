In his comments for <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01376/" target="_blank">Jivemaster&#8217;s remix &#8220;Lava Reach&#8221;</a> on Wednesday, djpretzel announced that <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/israfel/" target="_blank">Israfel</a> is voluntarily stepping down from his position on the Judges Panel &#8220;probably for good.&#8221;
      
He is the third judge to leave the Panel in since May. djpretzel did not name a replacement for him.      
&#8220;&#8230;a humongous thanks to Mike for his musical and critical contributions
  
to this site, which have incalculably improved our standards and vastly
  
widened our horizons,&#8221; djpretzel said.      
Israfel, A.K.A. Micheal Dover, has stepped down from
  
the Judges Panel once before due to time constraints, according to
  
djpretzel, but he &#8220;graciously returned&#8221; when his schedule became more
  
flexible.
