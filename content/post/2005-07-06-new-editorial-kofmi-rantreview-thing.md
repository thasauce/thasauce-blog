Sparked partly by recent discussion and by the lack of Xerol&#8217;s editorial, <a href="modules.php?name=Content&#038;pa=showpage&#038;pid=5" target="_self">I&#8217;ve gone and written one myself</a>.
  
In it, I take a look at a few reviews of King of Fighters: Maximum
  
Impact, which was recently released for XBOX, which bicker about such
  
trivial things as &#8220;the life gauges looking cheesy&#8221; as well as give my _own_ thoughts about the game.
