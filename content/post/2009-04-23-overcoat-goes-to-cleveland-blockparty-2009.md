So I braved the awful flight to Cleveland [and Cleveland itself] for Blockparty, which is hosted by Notacon, met up with virt, necros, a handful of people from #mod_shrine, and we just nerded it up for a full weekend. Consumed gallons of cocaine, coded java on cell phones, listened to <a href="http://gargaj.umlaut.hu/" target="_blank">Gargaj</a> regale stories of demoparties gone by, and had probably the worst &#8220;home cooked italian&#8221; food in all of Cleveland. All in all, except for the whole Cleveland part, fun times were had. I even got 6th in the allgear music compo! Hoohah!
