So yesterday I decided to start a game of Endless Marathon mode in Tetris DS, just to see how far I could make it. That a was around 6:30 PM, and I&#8217;m still going. I&#8217;m at level 165&#8230;
  
I can tell you right now that the game can&#8217;t particularly get much faster. The blocks kind of just PLANT themselves, and you have to spin them to get them where you wanted. >_< The people over in <a target="_blank" href="irc://irc.enterthegame.com/ClanOCR">#ClanOCR</a> (the IRC channel for all OCR related DS-ing), wanted a video so I upload it over at YouTube. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeF2LEBzjnY">Check it out!</a>
