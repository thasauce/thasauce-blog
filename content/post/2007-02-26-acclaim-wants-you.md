Press release from Acclaim Games:

_
  
Acclaim Games and video game
  
industry superstar David Perry have partnered to present the
  
ground-breaking &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; project. In this project, players actually
  
get an opportunity to participate in the entire video game_ _development process from start to finish.
  
_ 
  
_In an unprecedented move for the game industry, these players will be
  
given a chance to have their work featured in a massively multiplayer PC
  
game that will be published by Acclaim and directed by David Perry.
  
Perry will choose a winner from the contributors, and Acclaim will be
  
giving them a breath-taking prize,
  
&lsquo;A Video Game Industry Directorship&rsquo;, working on a new fully-funded
  
massively multiplayer online PC game. David Perry will be their
  
Executive Producer to help them as needed on their game, and once they
  
complete their project, they will even earn royalties from the game
  
sales!
  
_ 

_&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved the idea that someone, from their
  
bedroom, reveals their passion and talent, then suddenly can have an
  
absolutely stunning career explosion, becoming a famous Game Director
  
with a pre-built fan base. We&rsquo;re going to make it happen!&rdquo;_ _says David Perry who is a Game Director and Chief Creative Officer for Acclaim Games.
  
_ 

_
  
David Perry will be building the new online game from scratch and is offering members of the Acclaim player community a rare opportunity to help him develop this video
  
game in a collaborative effort with some of the industry&rsquo;s best talent.
  
&ldquo;We will bring in some surprise guests along the way to inspire and
  
mentor the contributors,&rdquo; says Perry.
  
_ 

_One lucky winner who shines the most during the development process will be given the top prize._  _&ldquo;This is the only chance I know of to jumpstart a directorship career in the video game industry,&rdquo;_ _continues Perry._ _
  
&ldquo;Everyone wins. They get to learn how to make professional games, and
  
if they get anything in, they get a real professional credit on their
  
resume.&rdquo; Perry finishes, &ldquo;But, if they win, well then they get their
  
life changed.&rdquo;_

_
  
Interestingly, applicants don&rsquo;t need any prior game development
  
experience. In fact, Perry refuses to look at resumes. &ldquo;We only care
  
about the pure, focused, passionate talent they show up with,&rdquo; he says.
  
_ 

_&ldquo;Top Secret is like &lsquo;The Apprentice&rsquo; meets &lsquo;American
  
Idol&rsquo; meets &lsquo;The Video Game Industry&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re giving our players a
  
chance to work on an online game that we will actually develop and
  
publish. Our community really loves these games and knows what it takes
  
to make a hit. And it will be a dream come true for one lucky star that
  
shines the most throughout the project,&rdquo;_ _says Acclaim CEO Howard Marks.
  
_ 

_This is a first-of-its-kind project from the new Acclaim, a resurrected
  
company with a very well known name. The new Acclaim will focus
  
entirely on providing quality multiplayer online games
  
for free. The games will be supported with a mix of advertising and
  
virtual item stores. Acclaim has already partnered with IGA Worldwide
  
to provide in-game advertising for its other online game titles. </p> 

The entry period will be limited, and so will the number of people
  
allowed in to see the project, so sign up now to become a team member
