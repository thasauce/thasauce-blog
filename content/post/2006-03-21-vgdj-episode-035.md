This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/): 

Ladies and gentlemen, brace yourselves. We&#8217;ve announced the winners of our intro contest! With sixteen entries total, it was difficult to choose, but if you didn&#8217;t make the top three, don&#8217;t sweat it! Prizes are still coming your way. For the rest of you out there who are just dying to get your hands on some official merchandise, check out our brand new, non-profit [VGDJ store](http://www.cafepress.com/vgdj).
  
Four ReMix Reviews (including the biggest mega-collab OCR has ever seen!), the latest and greatest on all the community meetups, a little drunk dialing, and finally&#8230; the WinglessMix. Don&#8217;t believe us? See for yourselves on this rockin&#8217; post-Patty&#8217;s Day show!
