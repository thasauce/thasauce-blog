Anyone who&#8217;s visted OverLooked Remix late&#8217;ll notice that the site is currently down down in an earlier round&#8230;
  
No worries, though. It&#8217;s not an elaborate hack job by BS Inc. or anything like that. Richter is simply moving the site to a new (an apparently much better) server. No word on exactly how long the transcition&#8217;ll take, but in the meantime you&#8217;re encouraged to visit the <a target="_blank" href="irc://newzealand.enterthegame.com/OLReMix">OLReMix chatroom</a>.
