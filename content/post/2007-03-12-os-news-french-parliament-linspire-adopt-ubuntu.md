This happened a little while ago, but thanks to the guys at Slashdot I was informed that Linspire was making a switch to use Ubuntu as it&#8217;s base instead of the traditional Debian distribution. Currently, Freespire 2.0 is slated to debut during the first quarter after the release of Ubuntu 7.04, codenamed Feisty Fawn, this April.

Also in Ubuntu news, the French Parliament has decided that they will replace Windows with the popular OS. It had been announced late last year that they were going to migrate, but had not decided on which distribution they would be using.
  
Thanks to Slashdot.
