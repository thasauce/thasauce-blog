Video game remixer [Flexstyle](http://flexstylemusic.com/wp/) has recently [an original electronic album titled &#8220;Eye of the Storm.&#8221;](http://flexstyle.bandcamp.com/album/eye-of-the-storm) The album is available via Bandcamp and is currently price at $0, but you are free to pay whatever you want for it via Bandcamp&#8217;s system.

From the Bandcamp page:

> Eye of the Storm chronicles&#8211;in audible and written form&#8211;the journey of a brave group of travelers through a mighty tempest. This is the fourth album from Glendale, AZ-based solo electronic artist Flexstyle, featuring a collaboration with up-and-coming Boulder, CO-based house musician Hollidayrain and a spectacular remix by Norman, OK-based electro producer PrototypeRaptor, winner of the Weeping Clouds remix competition. Included as bonus tracks (in the album download) are contest runners-up Moar and The Loopkitchen with their excellent Weeping Clouds remixes, along with a Flexstyle remix of Danish trance producer Airdrift&#8217;s song &#8220;Phoenix,&#8221; the original of which is available from Dangerbox Recordings. 

As someone who&#8217;s a bit over saturated by electronic music, I approached this album with a grain of sand, but was very pleasantly surprised. The album features 17 high-quality tracks available in 320kbps MP3, FLAC, Apple Lossless, and more and is thoroughly recommended for anyone who&#8217;s a fan of Flexstyle&#8217;s remixes.
