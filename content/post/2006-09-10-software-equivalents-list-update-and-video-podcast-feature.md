Just wanted to let you know that I recently updated the &#8220;<a href="http://www.studio-compyfox.de/testcorner/hw-research.php" target="_blank">Software Equivalents List</a>&#8221; to Hardware Instruments on my webpage. I added tons of new equivalents, did some minor tweaks and enhanced the DSP solution section. Also new is that the list is now linked on the main page of my webpage for easier access. More as usual on <a href="http://www.studio-compyfox.de" target="_blank">www.studio-compyfox.de</a>.
  
I
  
also like to point out that the &#8220;Software Equivalents List&#8221; was
  
featured in the just released Gearwire Crosstalk video podcast. You can
  
find the most recent episode <a href="http://www.gearwire.com/gearwire-crosstalk-017.html" target="_blank">here</a>,
  
including previews of Microsofts new Portable Player, two new music
  
communities and an in-depth tests of 3 Gibson Les Paul guitars

Gearwire Crosstalk is a weekly podcast featuring hardware and software reviews of recent releases in the music industry including sequencers, instruments and effects. Check out the people over at <a href="http://www.gearwire.com" target="_blank">www.gearwire.com</a>
