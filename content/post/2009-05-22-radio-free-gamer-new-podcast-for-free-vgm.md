Radio Free Gamer, the new podcast featuring free VGM, will start on 8bitx.com in June.  Until then, please email radiofreegamer@gmail.com with free original VGM, covers, arrangements, remixes, or music related to video games.  Stay tuned for more details!

<a href="www.8bitx.com" target="_blank">8-Bit Extravaganza</a>
  
will host a new podcast dedicated to free video game music, be it
  
original soundtracks, arrangements, remixes, or simply music related to
  
video games.  The goal of this show is to be a source for listeners to
  
learn about the many and varied VGM artists.
  
To that end, sources of free VGM are needed!  Please send links with
  
free VGM as described above to radiofreegamer@gmail.com.  As many
  
sources as possible are needed, so please send what you have.  If you
  
are a VGM artist yourself and would like to be featured or interviewed
  
on the show, please email us.

The show will begin in early June and be updated regularly.  More
  
details will be posted on 8bitx.com as they are available.  Please look
  
out for it!
