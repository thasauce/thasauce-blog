Hereâ€™s a really cool [video](http://youtu.be/D81na9YDADw) we recently found of Jin&#8217;ou Xia and her friend Xinxin Song who play their own adaptation to the Plants vs. Zombies soundtrack at Beijing Concert Hall in China. Using four gu-zheng, Xia and Song cleverly use trills to produce long, macabre sounds to recreate their own interesting version of [Laura Shigihara](http://laurashigihara.bandcamp.com/)â€™s goofy and original compositions. Jin&#8217;ou Xia is a recent graduate at the Central Conservatory of Music, one of the foremost music schools in Beijing.
