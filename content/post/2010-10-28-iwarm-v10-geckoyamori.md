Daniel BÃ¤rlin, alias GeckoYamori, is well-known around the interwebs. Whether it&#8217;s some old video game remixes of his or switching music from Super Nintendo games to Genesis instruments, he&#8217;s all over the place. He took some time out of his day earlier for a brief interview. This is the result.

M: What started your interest in video game music?

GY: Nodding my head to NES music I guess, I&#8217;ve been into it for as long as I&#8217;ve been into games.

M: I take it you&#8217;ve been into games for quite a while then?

GY: For as long as I can remember.

M: Nice. Same here! I honestly can&#8217;t recall a time when I wasn&#8217;t playing games. Hehe&#8230; Okay, next question. What started your interest in remixing?

GY: It just came sort of naturally since I&#8217;ve always had an interest in creating music, I had been into tracker music and such before I started remixing.

M: Makes sense; pretty much the same reason I started to make music. That and JH bugging me. Are there any tracks you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re more proud of than the others? Or that you like more?

GY: I am honestly not that fond of my early work in general, though I guess that applies to most musicians. I think <a title="Mega Man 2003" href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00878/" target="_blank">Mega Man 2003</a> (really made at the end of 2002) has aged decently compared to the others, even if it might be a rather uninspired mix from a creative standpoint.

M: As I said in another interview, think it was sixto&#8217;s, a true artist is never satisfied with their work.Are there any remixers you haven&#8217;t collaborated with in the past that you&#8217;d like to collaborate with in the future?

GY: Nekofrog keeps bugging me to collab and I&#8217;d like to, but neither of us have really pushed it enough to make it happen so far.

M: That would be a great remix; I&#8217;d love to hear it myself. Any tracks you&#8217;d like to remix in the future?

GY: I always try to give undermixed games some more attention, I have tried several times to remix tracks from Unreal and Red Alert, but I never show anything publicly unless I think it sounds awesome.

M: That&#8217;s a good reason to show it off. Hehe&#8230; Do you have a favorite track from a game?

GY: I suck at naming all-time favorites, there&#8217;s always something I will prefer over something else at different times. But from the above mentioned games, in Unreal I keep coming back to the Sunspire song and another called Surfacing, and in Red Alert I am more partial to the downtempo tracks like Snake or Vector, rather than the more popular metal stuff.

M: Well I never play favorites. I have like a list of 5 all-time, no wait 10, or 15&#8230; See, it just keeps getting longer! I can never decide which ones. Hehe&#8230; Do you have a favorite video-game composer?

GY: Same as with songs, I can never pick a single favorite. So I will settle for three favorites from Japan, Europe and Emerica. <a title="Composer Page" href="http://ocremix.org/artist/161/naofumi-hataya" target="_blank">Naofumi Hataya</a>, <a href="http://ocremix.org/artist/70/tim-follin" target="_blank">Tim Follin</a> and [Alexander Brandon](http://ocremix.org/artist/177/alexander-brandon).

M: I feel dumb for not knowing who Naofumi Hataya is&#8230;

GY: He composed for Sonic CD, parts of Sonic 3D, and Golden Axe 2-3.

M: Ah, well that&#8217;s some good music then. Lastly, what do you enjoy most about remixing video game music?

GY: Oh, I actually hate remixing video game music. I&#8217;m just in it for the fame.

M: Well I guess fame could be enjoyable&#8230; Thanks for your time; this was a fun interview!

GY: You&#8217;re welcome.
