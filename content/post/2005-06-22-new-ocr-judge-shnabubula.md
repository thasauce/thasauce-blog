After the recent retirement of Sir Malcos, Shnabubula is the latest OCR
  
connoisseur take his seat as one of the esteemed judges, to wade
  
through hundreds of crappy submissions from would be ReMixers.
  
Congratulations, good luck, and don&#8217;t let the abundance of abominable
  
tunes get you down. ðŸ˜‰
