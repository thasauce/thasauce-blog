No joke, straight from the <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendID=40033640&#038;blogID=187745024" target="_blank">MySpace blog</a>:

**Foundations Cover?</p> 

</strong>I have recorded a Build Me Up Buttercup!

And hats off to Lobachevsky, who&#8217;s been in fine shape during my sabbatacle.
  
Beefy,
  
Trenthian and Router: I&#8217;ll be tracking down the instrumentals to
  
Balloon Flight andÂ  Session so I can record my parts now. Assistance
  
would be appreciated! Sorry it took so long to get up and running
  
again, Guys.
