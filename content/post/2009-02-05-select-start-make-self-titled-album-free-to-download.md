  I have recently been informed that amazing six piece Florida band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/selectstartband">Select Start</a> have decided to put their self titled album up on their website as a free download. <a href="http://www.selectstartband.com/merch.html">Check this link</a> to download the album.

  Just click on the [link] to download the amazing 16 track album<br /> which includes songs from Zelda, Chrono Trigger, Mega Man, Metroid and<br /> a ton more! This is by far one of the most important albums any video<br /> game fan could have in their collection and now you have absolutely no<br /> excuse to not have it!
