This week on the show about video game music remixes at [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/): &#8216;Tis the season to be jolly! And in that vein, OCR is in a gift-giving frenzy with Chrono Symphonic&#8217;s pending release, the UnMod Awards, an anime mix from Pixietricks (hey, it rhymes!), and a new weekly community letter for Dain Olsen (i.e. Beatdrop), who has been recently dispatched to the U.S. Navy. Rayza&#8217;s voice shimmers with crystal clarity on this mic-erific episode, so listen up!
