Activision&#8217;s Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock for the Wii shipped out with a bug that only produced mono sound &#8211; a big deal in a game that&#8217;s all about the sound. Luckily, they&#8217;ve fixed the problem and have set up an exchange program for those with buggy discs.

<div class="quoted-text">
  We wanted to provide you with an update regarding the status of the Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock Wii replacement discs. The game has been approved by Nintendo and is currently in manufacturing. We expect to have the replacement discs available in February.
</div>

<div class="quoted-text">
  Once we have the discs, we will contact you and then send you a prepaid return envelop with a game exchange claim form. You should return the completed form with your current copy of the game. Once we receive a completed claim form and game, we will send you the replacement disc.</p>
