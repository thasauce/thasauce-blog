Following the release of [halc&#8217;s first chiptunes album, _Legitimacy_](/2013/01/23/halc-releases-chiptune-album-legitimacy/ "halc Releases Chiptune Album Legitimacy"), we now have another release from the talented composer.

<a href="http://halc.bandcamp.com/album/zero-g3-homeworld" target="_blank"><em>Zero-G3: Homeworld</em></a> is his latest effort, consisting of eight tracks of new, original &#8212; and awesome &#8212; material.

> The album incorporates retro sounds and heavily modulated, futuristic synths and effects, supported by loose hip-hop and broken-beat influenced grooves and a twinkly chiptune aftertaste.

The album is available on <a href="http://halc.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">halc&#8217;s Bandcamp</a> page. And, if it leaves you wanting more of his music, you can check out <a href="http://ocremix.org/artist/4793/halc" target="_blank">halc&#8217;s OCReMix profile</a>, as well as the site for his <a href="http://9bitrecords.com/" target="_blank">9-bit Records label</a>.
