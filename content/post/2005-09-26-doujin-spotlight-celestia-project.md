As probably the biggest doujin community event to happen this year, <a href="http://www.celestia-project.info/sb/" target="_blank">Celestia Project Vol. 1</a> was just unveiled last weekend. Aptly subtitled the &#8220;SquareEnix Music Arrange Festival,&#8221; the release spanned two days and a total of 87 (yes, eighty-seven) Square/Enix arrangements.
  
One need only to listen to the inaugural <a href="http://www.celestia-project.info/sb/ev01/sound/Vict_higauta.lzh" target="_blank">Chrono Trigger track</a> by the band Victy to realize how incredible this project is in terms of variety and overall arrangement quality. Definitely not to be missed by any fan of video game music.
