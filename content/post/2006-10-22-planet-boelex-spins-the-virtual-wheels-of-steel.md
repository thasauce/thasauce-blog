        I had read the thread [I probably check the mono211 board the most out of anyone due to rabid fanboyism] the day it was posted, but it didn&#8217;t really sink in that it was a MMO thing until just now, when Planet Boelex posted this image:

        I have no idea what Second Life is like, or if they&#8217;ve done this before, but hey, it&#8217;s news to me! This was a pre-recorded DJ set, but who can say for sure how long it will take before a band performs live via 3D CG avatars in a MMO setting?</p>
