So, since the panel at MAGFest I&#8217;ve been working pretty hard on a new version of <a href="../../../../undefined/http://www.thasauce.net" target="_blank">the site</a>.
  
The plan was to get across as much information as fast as possible, but
  
to do so in a generally quick and organized manner. I&#8217;ve been pulling a
  
lot inspiration from a lot of other sites I frequent, I&#8217;ve been trying
  
to integrate a lot of new community tools like <a href="http://stickam.com/thasauce" target="_blank">StickAM</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/thasauce" target="_blank">twitter</a>, and I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of time into making sure the page displays properly for all browsers.

As of right now we&#8217;ve moved into a &#8220;quasi&#8221; closed beta, and I hope to
  
have the whole site tested, and ready for launch by late March, early
  
Febuary (Suzu/Fusion willing).

  The video is kinda lengthy (about 14 mins), but in it I go through the<br /> new site, show off some of the new layout, detail some of the new<br /> features, and explain some of the stuff I&#8217;m working on. I apologize for<br /> the quality, and I&#8217;ll try to get a higher quality version up sometime<br /> later.

One more important note is, you&#8217;ll notice I&#8217;m not referring to the site
  
as &#8220;ThaSauce 3.0.&#8221; That&#8217;s because, in my eyes, this is not the 3rd
  
version of the site, this is the ONLY real version of the site.
  
Everything up until this point was merely testing, and planning, but
  
THIS site is truly what I&#8217;ve dreamed of since the beginning.
