title: Anonymous Editting Disabled on ThaWiki, Indefinately

Since in initial creation, we&#8217;ve allowed anonymous users to edit <a href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/ThaWiki" target="_blank">ThaWiki</a>. We knew it was a risky step to take, but the majority of mixers who HAVE entered in their biographies aren&#8217;t registered users, and we didn&#8217;t want to disinterest other people with having to sign up. However we&#8217;ve recently had <a href="http://wiki.thasauce.net/index.php/Special:Recentchanges" target="_blank">a bit more ad-spam than we&#8217;d like to have to deal with</a> .
  
As a result we&#8217;ve decided to disable the editting of pages by anonymous users. This will be, at the very LEAST, until we can find a way to lessen the ammount of ad-spam that makes its way onto ThaWiki. We hope that this doesn&#8217;t deter new users from signing up and helping out with filling pages on mixer biographies, original albums, and so on.
