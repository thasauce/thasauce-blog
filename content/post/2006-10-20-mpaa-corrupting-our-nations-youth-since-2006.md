According to a [recent story on the AP wire](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Scouts_Piracy_Patch.html), Boy Scouts in the Los Angeles area can now earn a merit badge by doing the MPAA&#8217;s bidding. The merit badge is given out to those who follow a curriculum designed by the movie industry itself. Dan Glickman, the chairman of the MPAA, had this to say: &#8220;Working with the Boy Scouts of Los Angeles, we have a real opportunity
  
to educate a new generation about how movies are made, why they are
  
valuable, and hopefully change attitudes about intellectual property
  
theft.&#8221; We&#8217;re with you there buddy, if by &#8220;educate&#8221; you mean &#8220;brainwash.&#8221; What&#8217;s next? RIAA Sunday School?
