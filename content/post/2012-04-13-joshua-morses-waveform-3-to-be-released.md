There&#8217;s no wonder that Nashville-based sound designer [Joshua Morse](http://jmflava.com/)&#8216;s progressive tune creations are some of the best in the VGM scene right now. With amazing recent releases likeÂ _[Onslaught! OST](http://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/onslaught-ost)_ and Â _[Waveform 2](http://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/waveform-2)_ that emphatically display such a loaded, eargasmic arsenal within the theÂ electronic-jazz fusion genre, Morse&#8217;s talents as a composer are fully realized.

On April 24th, Joshua Morse will be releasing his third album in what may be considered a series of FM-based music, which he began in 2007 with the first _[Waveform](http://www.iimusic.net/catalog/2007/10/waveform)_&#8216;sÂ blend of Yamaha TX81Z, MDA DX10, and various sampled FM percussion, followed by the 2011 release of _Waveform 2_ with a coalescence of SNES music styled by Morse himself.

Especially with what we&#8217;ve heard of so far, we&#8217;re absolutely STOKED for _Waveform 3_ to be released within the next two weeks. For fans, Morse is also offering a special incentive for &#8216;liking&#8217; his Facebook page. If the page reaches over 700 likes, Morse will be releasing the album **for free**. If not, the album is scheduled at retail value for $5. Free > five dollars = please support Mr. Morse and like his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/joshuamorsemusic) right now!
