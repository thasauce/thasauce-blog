So first of all, I&#8217;d like to say thanks to everyone who came out and submitted stuff to ReMx:ThaSauce over the past few weeks. We really appreciate it, guys. There&#8217;s so much great music out there just waiting to be heard, and we wanna make sure it reaches as many people as possible. 

I&#8217;ve gone ahead and posted what I have TAGGED AND READY to be posted i<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.thasauce.net/viewtopic.php?p=336#336">n the thread on the QC forums</a>. This isn&#8217;t a concrete list of what I have, or what&#8217;s going to be direct posted, but more an idea of where I am RIGHT NOW. Expect some updates to this thread, and <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.thasauce.net/viewforum.php?f=13">the QC forums in general</a> over the next week or so. <a target="_self" href="http://forums.thasauce.net/groupcp.php?g=8">Our Arbiters</a> are probably going to have to come out of hibernation for a bit, too =P

On top of that there&#8217;s been some dicussion about reforming <a target="_blank" href="http://vgdj.net">VGDJ</a> @ OCR, and it brought up the reminder that <a target="_blank" href="http://saucecast.thasauce.net/">WE haven&#8217;t done a podcast in some time</a>. I&#8217;d been busy with <a target="_blank" href="http://dougarley.com">finishing up school</a>, and starla had a few things she&#8217;s been taking care of too. I think we&#8217;re ready to start getting something going again, and I know I said I&#8217;d have one ready by last Friday, but really there&#8217;s just <a target="_blank" href="news/814">so</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://shaelbopp.livejournal.com/679913.html">much</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Illidan&#038;n=Disciples+of+the+Mix&#038;p=1">to cover</a> we&#8217;re having trouble fitting it all into 1 show. Anywhere we&#8217;re pretty close to (if not totally done with) ironing out what we plan to put in the next show, so you guys should expect one VERY VERY SOON&#8230;but seriously.

Lastly I&#8217;d still like to remind people that, even though I got a good ammount of submissions lately, they&#8217;re still pretty far and few between overall. So keep&#8217;em comin&#8217;. We wanna make sure all the music we can gets to as many people as possible, and the best way to do that is to have a constant flow of stuff coming in.

If you didn&#8217;t see it on ReMix:ThaSauce my original post is here:

<div class="quoted-text">
  So, some people think we&#8217;re dead, but we&#8217;re not. I ASSURE YOU. We&#8217;re just in a dry spell for submissions (unofficial count right now is 1 to be QC&#8217;d and 1 to be posted, but don&#8217;t quote me on that because I&#8217;m not exactly checking RIGHT NOW).</p> 
  
  <p>
    That in mind&#8230;SUBMIT. If you submitted before and have new stuff? Submit! If you submitted before and got rejected? SUBMIT! If you know someone who has a song that they&#8217;ve finished but haven&#8217;t posted it anywhere or got it rejected from OCReMix? Tell them to submit! If you submitted a song and it didn&#8217;t get posted and it didn&#8217;t go to the qc RESUBMIT! It happens sometime (except you, Bren. I got you.)
