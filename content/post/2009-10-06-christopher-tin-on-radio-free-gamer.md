This week on Radio Free Gamer, we will be joined by composer
  
Christopher Tin to discuss how his work, &#8220;Baba Yetu&#8221;, has impacted his
  
career as well as the debut of his new album &#8220;Calling All Dawns!&#8221; The
  
album is getting amazing press, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to this
  
interview. Anyone who hasn&#8217;t checked this out should definitely visit
  
Christopher&#8217;s site. 
  
Of course, we&#8217;ll also have some great, free video game music, the win and fail of the week, and more! Listen live at 7PM EST Wednesday, immediately following Average Joe Gamer here on 8bitx.com. This is going to be a good episode, so don&#8217;t miss it!
