Back at the Chrono Compendium, I&#8217;ve finished a 2000 word feature highlighting some of the methods of contacting SE that **wont** change anything, and I also provide SE&#8217;s mailing address as well as an example letter that actually does have a chance of helping to convince them to make a new Chrono game. Too long have fanboys been crapping up SE&#8217;s customer support with hateful e-mails, bad grammer and stupid ideas. If you&#8217;d like to see some of the worst examples, and check out how to actually help, it&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.chronocompendium.com/Stories/24" target="_blank">http://www.chronocompendium.com/Stories/24</a> .
