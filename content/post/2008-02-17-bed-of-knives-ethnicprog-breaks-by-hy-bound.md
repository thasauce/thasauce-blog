  I did this song for the<br /> Promo CD <a href="http://www.sgxmusic.com/" target="_blank">[sgx]</a>&#8216;s giving out with his physical album of Hero of the Grey<br /> Area (which is great by the way). It started out as pretty much a<br /> complete rip-off of Hybrid&#8217;s &#8220;We Are In Control&#8221; and then evolved from<br /> there. Im going to actually include it on my first album that will<br /> hopefully be coming out late next year.
