    After nearly a dedicate of being some of EnterTheGame&#8217;s biggest, most popular channels, #ocremix, #ocrwip, #thasauce, and many other related channels have migrated to EsperNet. This decision came after a long-time (something something) of EnterTheGames practices and policies.

    These channels join a number of other channels already established on EspertNet including chat channels for community partners MAGFest, Dwelling of Duels, and VGMusic.
