Saw this on GAF, and I figure this is ABSOLUTELY worth sharing:

Typically, when a video game company has a major announcement, they
  
might let some press outlets know about it beforehand, but put the
  
information on embargo. This sometimes involves legally binding NDAs.
  
But if such an agreement was penned with _Seattle PI_/_The New York Times_, they couldn&#8217;t care less. They just stole the Wii press event&#8217;s thunder and announced the Wii launch details.

The Wii will be released on November 19 in North and South America and
  
will cost $250 in the United States. 4 million units will be shipped
  
worldwide, far exceeding the shipments of Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 3.

25-30 games will be available for the Wii this year. As many speculated, [_Wii Sports_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Wii%20Sports) will be packed in with every system. [_Super Mario Galaxy_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Super%20Mario%20Galaxy), as many also speculated, will not be available until 2007.

Nintendo will make about 30 classic games available for download
  
via Virtual Console when the Wii is released, including games from the [_Zelda_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Zelda), [_Mario_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Mario), and [_Donkey Kong_](http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/search.php?by=Game&search=Donkey%20Kong) franchises. Downloadable games will cost about $5 to $10 each.

The price of retail Wii games will be $50, $10 less than Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games.

&#8220;Our goal is to bring gaming back to the masses,&#8221; Reggie Fils-Aime,
  
president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, said in a
  
telephone interview. &#8220;You see that in our pricing, you see that in the
  
number of units we plan to make available this year and you see that in
  
how we are positioning the Wii to appeal to every member of the
  
household, including but not limited to the hard-core gamer.&#8221;

A surprise from Nintendo is that they will be including &#8220;channels,&#8221;
  
which are meant to appeal to casuals who don&#8217;t consider themselves
  
gamers. A photo channel allows users to use the Wii to display photos
  
on their TV. There will also be an interactive news channel and a
  
weather channel.

Additionally, the Wii will come with a built-in web browser, most likely Opera.

&#8220;We are including all of these capabilities as part of our overall
  
strategy to expand the gaming market,&#8221; Fils-Aime said. &#8220;Broadening the
  
market is important because it will breathe new life into this
  
business. Otherwise, this industry is moving down a path of being more
  
and more limited to the hard-core gamer.&#8221;

Lots of Wii news from the _Times_. The official announcements
  
will come Thursday at an event in New York City. Prior to that (not
  
long now) will be a Japanese event.
