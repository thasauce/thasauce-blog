In case you haven&#8217;t noticed it yet, there&#8217;s a new calendar module on
  
the right of the main page, just below the user info panel. The
  
objective of this is to give you guys a quick glance of what&#8217;s going on
  
in the community. You can submit your own calendar events (birthdays,
  
radio shows, compos, etc) by clicking on the calendar link to your
  
left, and clicking on &#8216;Create an Event&#8217;. Before you do this however, I
  
implore you to read the [Calendar FAQ](modules.php?name=FAQ&myfaq=yes&id_cat=4&categories=Submitting+Calendar+Events), and keep your events along the guidelines posted therein. Thanks for your time. ðŸ˜‰
