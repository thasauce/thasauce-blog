A recent email from Video Games Live has made a few announcements and one of it&#8217;s biggest, it&#8217;s online store; is now open. The store can be found <a href="http://www.videogameslive.com/shop/index.php?cPath=21" target="_blank">here</a>.
  
Also taken from the email was a quote about their progress on DVD&#8217;s or soundtracks for VGL!

&#8220;A lot of people have asked us about VGL DVD&rsquo;s or soundtracks. We are currently working on this and have been filming and recording all of our shows. We hope to have something out by the end of the year. We&rsquo;ll definitely keep you posted.&#8221;
