This time&#8217;s spotlight is <a href="http://www.ismusic.ne.jp/tequila/" target="_blank">OUTSIDER</a>, the website of &#8220;Tequila.&#8221;
  
He&#8217;s got a lot of nice, mostly guitar-based arrangements from Ragnarok Online, Tales of Phantasia, and the Final Fantasy and Seiken Densetsu series. I personally recommend&#8230;well, pretty much all of it. Just check it out!

Also, this is my tenth news post. w00t! ðŸ˜€
