From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magfest.org/">MAGFest.org</a>:

_So, we&#8217;ve done a lot of talking, and while we haven&#8217;t finalized anything yet, we know one thing:</p> 

People don&#8217;t want to wait a year to rock out again.

So, this summer, we&#8217;re looking into holding an outdoor event with many of the same bands you heard at MAGFest, and probably more bands that you didn&#8217;t hear at MAGFest!</em>
  
_Entry would be cheap; we don&#8217;t want it to interfere with your summer convention plans, if you have any. </p> 

What we&#8217;re asking now is that anyone that wants to get involved &#8212; whether it be planning, playing, or attending &#8212; get in touch with us. And of course, feel free to talk about it on the <a target="_blank" href="http://magfest.org/forum_message.php?thread_id=348&#038;forum_id=2">forums</a>.</em>
