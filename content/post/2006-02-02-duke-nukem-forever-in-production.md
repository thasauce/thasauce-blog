_An anonymous reader writes &#8220;Like that fungus under your keyboard, Duke Nukem Forever never really seems to go away. Well in the latest installment in unsubstantiated DNF rumors it appears that [the game is finally in production](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/02/01/duke-nukem-forever-in-full-production/). Via Joystiq &#8220;everyone&#8217;s favorite vaporware is &#8220;in full production&#8221; according to George Broussard, co-founder of 3D Realms. In an interview with 1up, towards the end, Broussard chats about the status of Duke Nukem Forever, the unfortunately-apt title to the game over a decade in development.&#8221;_</p>
