That&#8217;s not a joke, some team has ported original DOOM to the iPod.

Currently iDoom works on the following iPods:

  * iPod 1G (scroll wheel) 
  * iPod 2G (touch wheel) 
  * iPod 3G (disorientated keys) 
  * iPod 4G (click wheel) 
  * iPod Photo 
  * iPod Color 
  * iPod Mini (both versions) 
  * iPod nano
