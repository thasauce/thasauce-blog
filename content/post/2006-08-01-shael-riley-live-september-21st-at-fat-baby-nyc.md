    I can offer very limited crash space on a first-come first-serve<br /> basis, unless Juese comes third or fourth, in which case I&#8217;ll kick you<br /> out if you came before him, because I really like Juese. Seriously,<br /> though, I can only put up one or two people so if you can work<br /> something out with someone local or spring for hotel accomodations,<br /> muchos gracias, mi amiga/o.
