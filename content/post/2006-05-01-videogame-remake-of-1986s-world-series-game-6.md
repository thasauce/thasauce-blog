From <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/30/194205" target="_blank">slashdot</a>:

_Even non-baseball fans must concede that the [re-creation](http://duffx.com/videos/random/RBIGameSix.wmv)
  
of the bottom half of the 10th inning of Game Six of the 1986 World
  
Series, using the original broadcast audio and a replay with Nintendo&#8217;s
  
[RBI Baseball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rbi_baseball), took enormous dedication._
  
_&#8216;Something like the Keith Hernandez at-bat, where he flies out to center, [took like 200 attempts](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114591515205534499-_LY6O4wCKxN2DLMUHLmM3ixtZsg_20070428.html?mod=blogs),&#8217;
  
Creator Conor Lastowka told WSJ.com. Though it wasn&#8217;t quite as hard as
  
it looks: &#8216;Thanks to the emulator software, each time Mr. Hernandez&#8217;s
  
at-bat strayed from history&#8217;s script, Mr. Lastowka was able to replay
  
from the previous at-bat. Using a computer rather than an actual game
  
console like a PlayStation allowed Mr. Lastowka to save his progress
  
along the way. He built his precise Game-Six replica bit by bit &#8212; not
  
in one flawless, improbable take.&#8217; Before he made the viral video,
  
Lastowka was jobless; three days after its release, he had a job with a
  
classic-films company._
