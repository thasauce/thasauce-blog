  Chinese manufacturer and marketer Big Electronic Games Limited is<br /> soon to start selling 62-inch high authentic, stand-up arcade machines<br /> (and tabletop ones too) with a Midway license. The available games<br /> include Defender I + II, Joust, Rootbeer Tapper and eight other games.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mybiggames.com/w_index_002.htm"></a>
</div>

The
  
arcade machine itself has a built in color monitor. Additional A/V
  
inputs allow other things (DVD, game systems, etc.) to be plugged in
  
and viewed on the monitor.
