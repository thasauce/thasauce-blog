_[Bit Gen Gamer Fest 7](http://www.bitgengamerfest.com/)_ is here and ready to rock your world! Originally started up by the folks behind the video game rock band [Entertainment System](https://www.facebook.com/EntertainmentSystem)Â in a small private art space in 2005 with only 150 people,Â Baltimore&#8217;s premier videogame music festival has grown into one of the most biggest, action-packed concerts on the East Coast and is only expected to get even more monumental.Â This yearâ€™s venue,Â [Sonar Baltimore](http://sonarbaltimore.com/), is one of the largest concert club venues in Baltimore, with a capacity that is almost 18 times greater than the total attendance of the firstÂ _Bit Gen_Â concert.

Oh, so gaming and rocking out is your thing, you say? Well, the line-up for Big Gen Gamer Fest 7 has also been made public, with incredible upcoming performances fromÂ [The Megas](http://themegas.com/main/main.html), [Metroid Metal](http://www.metroidmetal.com/), [Bit Brigade](http://www.bitbrigade.com/), [Rare Candy](http://www.rarecandyband.com/), [This Place is Haunted](http://thisplaceishaunted1.bandcamp.com/), [Brentalfloss](http://brentalfloss.com/home.cfm), [Dj Cutman](http://www.djcutman.com/), [Cheap Dinosaurs](http://filefreakout.com/cheapdinosaurs/), [X-Hunters](http://xhunters.bandcamp.com/) with even more performers to be announced soon.
