From <a target="_blank" href="http://gamemusic4all.blogspot.com/2009/03/hey-listen-volume-3-mixtape-from-game.html">GMFA</a>:

<div class="quoted-text">
  I am very happy to announce volume 3 in a monthly series of 5 song &#8220;mixtapes&#8221; from GM4A. The series is called Hey! Listen! and asks you to do just that! Check out the <a href="http://gamemusic4all.blogspot.com/2009/01/hey-listen-volume-1-mixtape-from-game.html">first mixtape page</a><br /> for info about how this mixtape series works. We are bringing you an<br /> extra heavy dose of VG rock on this album from the likes of Chile based<br /> ThePlasmas as well as East Coast rockers Rare Candy! Not only that, but<br /> we have a great laid back VG remix from all around nerd musician sli,<br /> and some great nerdcore hip hop from hiphopmcdougal. We top it all off<br /> with a beautiful closing song from NES Rock newcomers I Fight Dragons.<br /> All this is wonderfully labeled with artwork by good friend Leo<br /> Camacho. Well don&#8217;t just sit there, dig in!

        About the artwork:<br /> The<br /> artwork is a remixed version of an art piece titled &#8220;The Unusual<br /> Suspects.&#8221; The artwork was created last minute by Leo Camacho (who will<br /> be next months artist as well), so huge thanks to him on putting<br /> something great together on only a few days notice! Sadly we had our<br /> original artist have to drop off the project due to family affairs, but<br /> best of luck to her, and hope to have her on a future album!
