[Christopher Tin](http://www.christophertin.com) has just made history by being the first composer to receive a Grammy for a song composed for a video game. Tin&#8217;s Baba Yetu from Civilization IV won the award for **Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)** at the 53rd Grammy Awards this evening.



Baba Yetu, while appearing as the first track on Tin&#8217;s debut album,&#8221;[Calling All Dawns,](http://www.christophertin.com/callingalldawns.html)&#8221; it was originally composed as the theme song for Civilization IV. Since it has been performed at numerous Video Games Live concerts. In addition, &#8220;Calling All Dawns&#8221; itself also won the Grammy for **Best Classical Crossover Album**, and includes judge, OC ReMix, and friend (<3) [Jillian Aversa](http://jillianaversa.com/) on the song &#8220;[Sukla-Krsne](http://www.christophertin.com/assets/lyrics/11Sukla-Krsne.html)&#8220;.

Will we ever see a day where video game soundtracks start making their way into the Grammy&#8217;s in full force? Well it might still be some time from now, but this is confirmation that we&#8217;re moving in the right direction.

Congratulations to Chris, and may he keep creating excellent scores and songs like this one.
