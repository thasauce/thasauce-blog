The latest Dwelling of Duels special competition is over, and the results <a target="_blank" href="http://dod.vgmix.com/joke/">are now available.</a> The theme this time was to make a video game remix as humorous as possible (audio dramas were not eligible for this contest).
  
<span class="small">The theme of the regular July competition is Mario<br /> games, with entries due on the 28th at 6 AM PST. And in case you missed<br /> them, the results for the June 2005 DoD (a free month) can be found <a target="_self" href="http://dod.vgmix.com/past/june05/">here.</a></span>
