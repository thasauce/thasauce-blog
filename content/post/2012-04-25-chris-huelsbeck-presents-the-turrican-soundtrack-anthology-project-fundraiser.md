From [remix64.com](http://www.remix64.com/turrican_fundraiser.html):

Featuring a cosmic hero in a silver battlesuit, theÂ _Turrican_series of games brought nonstop action to all gaming systems of the 80's and 90's, including C64 and Amiga, Atari ST and PC, as well as Genesis and Super Nintendo. The beautiful synthesizer scores for these games were created by Chris HÃ¼elsbeck, arguably one of today's most popular game music composers in the world. HÃ¼elsbeck's soundtracks certainly played a major role in shapingÂ _Turrican_ into a digital legend over the years.

Almost 20 years have passed since the last game in the series was released, but Chris has big plans to bringÂ _Turrican_ back from retirement â€“ at least musically â€“ with the production of theÂ _Turrican_ Soundtrack Anthology: The idea behind this is an epic limited edition box set of at least three CDs, which will feature almost every melody from the saga in newly arranged and recorded versions (including titles like **&#8220;**Concerto for Laser and Enemies&#8221;, **&#8220;**Metal Stars&#8221;, **&#8220;**Hall of Heroes&#8221;, as well as full length versions of all main titles and end-credits!). While this box set is bound to please every synthesizer music fan out there, new bonus recordings with the WDR Radio Orchestra are also lined up for the project, to be realised in the context of a symphonic game music concert in November and supervised by the producers of the acclaimedÂ _Symphonic Shades â€“ HÃ¼elsbeck in Concert_Â event.

In order to realize these ambitious plans, a budget of at least 75,000 US-Dollars (about 58,000 Euro) has to be secured. To achieve this, Chris is now asking his fans to support him in a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chris-huelsbeck/turrican-soundtrack-anthology-by-chris-huelsbeck) to make theÂ _Turrican Anthology_ become a reality. &#8220;My first Turrican album has sold 10.000 units over the years&#8221;, Huelsbeck says, &#8220;I know that the games still have a following, too. This project is a personal dream of mine and I hope that together we can make this happen!&#8221;

Aside from the finished CDs, supporters of the project can get their hands on numerous goodies like posters, t-shirts,Â _Turrican_ ringtones for their mobiles, or even tickets for an orchestral game music concert that will take place in November in Cologne, Germany. Those who are willing to support the project with a larger sum may take an exclusive look behind the scenes and will be personally informed by Chris about the progress during the production. Detailed information on the campaign, running from **April 16<sup>th</sup>Â to June 3<sup>rd</sup>**, can be found at:Â <a href="http://www.turricansoundtrack.com/" target="_blank">www</a><a href="http://www.turricansoundtrack.com/" target="_blank">.</a><a href="http://www.turricansoundtrack.com/" target="_blank">turricansoundtrack</a><a href="http://www.turricansoundtrack.com/" target="_blank">.</a><a href="http://www.turricansoundtrack.com/" target="_blank">com</a>.
