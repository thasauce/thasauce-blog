Below is a link that will hopefuly lead you to the first D.O.C.
  
compotetion or dwelling of the chiptunes hosted by none other than
  
local chiptune enthusiast Spamtron! The first round was somewhat short
  
notice and thus had a small turnout. However you can still vote for the
  
current songs that made it through :)! Votes are accepted untill
  
Saturday the 23rd of September at Midnight West Coast 3:am East Cost
  
time. You have 10 points to distribute however you wish for
  
original compositions and 5 points to distribute for cover songs. Make
  
your voice count and send your votes/submitions to **<span class="postbody">guerinator [at] gmail.com</span>**! 
  
Enjoy listening to what made it this round and get pumped for round 2
  
which has just started and ends October 14th! Rules for the compotetion
  
can be found on the site itself. Basicaly, any hardwear/software that
  
has a nice retro chipy sound is welcomed! From 8-bit sqaure waves to
  
the 16-bit Fm sounds of the Sega Genesis! The focus here is not exact
  
specifications. Rather it&#8217;s on having fun and getting everyone a chance
  
to get involved! So dust off that tracker or whatever you have and get
  
creative. The more entiers the better. Let&#8217;s make this next one a D.O.C
  
to remember :)!

A big thanks in advance to everyone who participates in any fasion. Be
  
sure to drop by the temp Shizz Shelter forums and leave us some
  
comments if you can! If you do vote, try to vote fair :). Above all
  
enjoy listening and hopefuly making your own chip-tunes for round 2 and
  
beyond :)!
