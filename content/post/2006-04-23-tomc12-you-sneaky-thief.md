The twelfth installment of the Thematic Original Music Competition gets underway with the theme selected by Flik: the always euphamistic &#8220;treasure hunter&#8217;s theme&#8221;.
  
As Flik describes it:

_&#8220;It has been raining all day long, but as dusk sets on the city the rain has let up, and all inhabitants of the city are eager to step out of their homes for a while. Some going to the pubs, some doing late night shopping. Fortunatly &#8220;shopping&#8221; is your specialty. While the people are away, the skilled thief goes to play&#8230;and work. Do you have the cunning skill that it takes to be a master thief, or will an armed citizen or city watchman be your end?&#8221;_
