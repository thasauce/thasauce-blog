Check it out folks because the Web site is up and tickets are on sale! Things are going well for the concert. We&#8217;re looking at getting sponsorship by our local EB Games and GameStop, along with some donations from our local gaming stores. My new friend Rick will be bringing at least six arcade games with him in addition to the Street Fighter II Arcade Game that we&#8217;ll be giving away in the tournament, so we&#8217;ll have some great arcade games on free play at the event. The University of Arkansas gaming clubs are getting ready to run the tournaments, and we&#8217;re also getting ready to set up radio promotions which will play on our local radio stations. Once the radio commercials start, the tickets will get eaten up pretty quick, so if you&#8217;re coming from out of town, make sure you buy your ticket sooner than later.
