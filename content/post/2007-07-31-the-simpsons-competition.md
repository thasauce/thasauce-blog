Have you ever loved those pinks donuts so much? Simpsons has always
  
been one of the top shows in America, I salute the Simpsons for the
  
unrivaled humor and creative plotlines. This show has been around for
  
around 18 years (had a short in 1987 and developed into a real show 3
  
seasons later). Personally, I would have to say my favorite character
  
is probably the same as everyone else &#8211; Homer. With his lack of
  
intellect, and inability to lead a family or even hold onto a job &#8211; he
  
makes every man not only able to point and laugh, but makes us feel
  
that there is a lower man out there.

Anyways &#8211; this competition is as follows &#8211; All submissions are to be in
  
this coming Sunday (August 5th). You can remix any song from this
  
series (there are 53, I have the entire archive, not hard to find imo)
  
and of course I recommend the theme song. All submissions will be sent
  
to me and I&#8217;ll assign a few people to listen and judge (we&#8217;ll combine
  
the scores at the end).

Let me know if you plan on either participating with a remix or if you are interested in judging.
