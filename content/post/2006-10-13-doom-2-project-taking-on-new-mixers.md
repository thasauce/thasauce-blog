On October 13th, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/theorichalcon/">TO</a> posted an update to the Doom 2 Project on OCRemix, saying:

_&#8220;The mixerlist has been culled due to inactivity. The mixers that were on those tracks can still be a part of the project, so long as they submit me a final version. I won&#8217;t sit anyone on the track unless I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get a final version from them.&#8221;_
  
You can see what tracks are available and how to join the project here: [http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=71824.](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=71824)
