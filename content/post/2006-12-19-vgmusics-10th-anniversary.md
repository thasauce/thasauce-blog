From [VGMusic.com](http://www.vgmusic.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=6814):

_&#8220;10 years ago today I founded the Videogame Music Archive on a small little corner of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank">Geocities</a>. Along the way, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981212022001/http://vgmusic.com/" target="_blank">other staff members joined the fun</a>, and the site has grown <a href="http://www.vgmusic.com/information/milestones.shtml" target="_blank">year after year</a>.
  
Our hit counter died a while ago, but according to Google Adsense, we
  
had over 25 million page impressions over the past year! We&#8217;re older
  
than <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;q=video+game+music&#038;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Google</a> (8 years old), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGMusic.com" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> (5 years old), and even <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/20/1457222" target="_blank">Slashdot</a> (9 years old)._
  
_&#8220;Our dynamic community of volunteer staff, sequencers, forum patrons,
  
and general visitors have kept us going strong! To show our
  
appreciation, we are conducting our largest giveaway to date: one lucky
  
winner can get the <a href="http://www.vgmusic.com/contests/giveaway8.html" target="_blank">Top 10 Albums at GameMusic.com!</a> </p>
