We&#8217;ve actually <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.thasauce.net/viewforum.php?f=18">had this feature</a> working SOMEWHAT for quite awhile now (albeit a few automation issues). I&#8217;ve finally decided to activate it for a number of reasons.

  1. <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.thasauce.net/">Our forums</a> are sexier than ever now.
  2. Spam on the site is a constant problem and exists almost exclusively in the forums.
  3. There&#8217;s a lot of changes coming up, and this is pretty much going to be the basis of all comments. So I might as well get this over with now.
