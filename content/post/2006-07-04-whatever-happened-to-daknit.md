Well he turned into a beatnik&#8230;ok not really, but he&#8217;d certainly lead you to believe so&#8230;

From the thread on <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86954" target="_blank">OCReMix</a>:

&#8220;<span class="postbody">Quick update, I don&#8217;t do remixes as much anymore, but I&#8217;m now into<br /> video. I got a weekly Blog/Show called Daknit Video found on You tube.<br /> I got 2 and 1/2 episodes up now (they are kinda crappy in quality) and<br /> I&#8217;m working on a third for this weekend. Plus, you finally get a chance<br /> tosee what i look like. (if you care) I&#8217;ll also try to do a quick<br /> midweek video. something short and entertaining. And yes, that&#8217;s a OC<br /> mix I&#8217;m using as my theme. No, it&#8217;s not mine. i&#8217;m &#8220;barrowing&#8221; it until<br /> I can find a better.</p>

  ANYwho, I hope to see you all around. And you younglings, quit trying to kick me. =P&#8221;</span><br /> <span class="postbody">Daknit is still Daknit.<br /> <br /> =P</p>
