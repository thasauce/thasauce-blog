The Bad Dudes (ie: Mustin and friends) have released a new EP entitled _Zombies Rocked My Neighbors_. Here&#8217;s a quote from the web site:

<div class="quoted-text">
  &#8220;The Bad Dudes are back with another EP of some freaky business for you all. It&#8217;s<br /> Halloween and time to scare some kids. So we deliver unto you some scary tracks<br /> (and well, some not so scary tracks, but they rock anyway). Put them on your<br /> Haunted House playlists for the neighborhood kids or just freak out your friends<br /> by locking them in the closet for a few weeks, not feeding them, and making them<br /> listen to zyko. ouch. Enjoy this freaky business and we&#8217;ll deliver more sooner<br /> than later.&#8221;
