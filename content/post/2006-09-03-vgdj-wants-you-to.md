From the VGDJ website, &#8220;Ten hut! General Zircon and Admiral Pixietricks here. The
  
podcastalley.com campaign has begun, and we&#8217;re looking for a few good
  
men (and women).&#8221;

&#8220;Soooo&#8230; to advance our cause, we have recorded a [televised, technicolor broadcast](http://www.vgdj.net/Misc/call_to_arms.mov) for viewing on your home computer. Do your civic duty this month, and [follow this link](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140). VGDJ out!

P.S. You&#8217;ll need to download the latest version of Quicktime (7.0) to
  
view this movie. RealPlayer and/or VLC are also options.&#8221;
