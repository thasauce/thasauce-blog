<img border="0" align="right" src="http://h.xerol.org/i/m6logo150.jpg" />[Details](http://magfest.org/info/) for MAGFest 6 have been announced. It will once again be the first weekend of January, from the 3rd through the 6th, in a new location at the Hilton Mark Center in Alexandria, VA.

The discounted hotel rate from previous years continues, at $99/night this year, but reservations are not open yet. An announcement will be made once the room block is open. In addition to being accessible by any major highway on the east coast, the hotel offers a shuttle from DCA.

While too soon to confirm a guest list, many of [previous year&#8217;s attendees](http://magfest.org/section.php?8) are likely to return, as well as retaining the familiar format of games, music, and fun.
