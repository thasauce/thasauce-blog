Call-In Topic 8/4
  
&#8220;A CELEBRATION OF AVERAGENESS&#8221;

In radio, we&#8217;re always discussing &#8220;the best of&#8221;, or &#8220;the worst of&#8221;. To break the cycle, we&#8217;ll be doing a show that&#8217;s just _okay_.
  
Not wonderful. Also, we&#8217;ll be talking about our favorite mediocre
  
movies and games and comics and stuff. To suggest something average,
  
use the toll-free number listed above.
  
**Start Time**: 18:00
  
**Ending Time**: 21:00

**Event Description**:
  
The Jump Button 6-9pm EST
  
Music from Video Games, Cartoons, & Anime

Listen Live @ [<u>WHFR.FM</u>](http://whfr.hfcc.net/content.php?page=listen)
