  You all know Shawn Phase, right? In the latest Nintendo Power, Shawn is featured next to some yummy cookies and cake.

Anyway, some of you may have had the fortune to meet Shawn in person before. I did, at MAGFest. He also participates in DoD and resides in #vgmix.

Be sure to congratulate him when you run into him. ðŸ™‚

That&#8217;s one good looking cookie&#8230;
