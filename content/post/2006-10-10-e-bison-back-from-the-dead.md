Yeah, you heard me! E-Bison mentions on his Devil&#8217;s Lab OCReMix Work-In-Progress, &#8220;<span class="postbody">Been gone for a long time. 3 years now. Happy to see my CT remix is still being played.&#8221;</span>
  
<span class="postbody">&#8220;I came on here to show off my new videogame themed ska album. After<br /> reading comments about my old tracks I decided to post a WIP track for<br /> old times sake: </p> 

<p>
  It&#8217;s a glitch remix of Devil&#8217;s lab. As usual, don&#8217;t be haitin&#8217; because<br /> I change the melodic material and form around&#8230; It&#8217;s supposed to be a<br /> remix right?
</p>

<p>
  Let me know what you think. I&#8217;ll submit it if you guys think I&#8217;ll make it through the gauntlet.
