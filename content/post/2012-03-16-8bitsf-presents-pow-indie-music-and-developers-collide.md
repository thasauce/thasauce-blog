</center>In commemoration of the Game Developer&#8217;s Conference occurring in San Francisco this week,Â 

<a title="8bitSF" href="http://www.8bitsf.com/" target="_blank">8bitSF</a>Â decided to hold a chiptune show. Gathering artists such as minusbaby, Freaky DNA, A_Rival, Disasterpeace, and virt, the show featured a variety of chiptune styles.

<a title="Louis Gorenfield's site" href="http://soundcloud.com/extentofthejam/tracks" target="_blank">Louis Gorenfield</a>Â kicked the night off immediately, playing some of his own original creations. Next up wasÂ <a title="The Glowing Stars's site" href="http://theglowingstars.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">The Glowing Stars</a>, whose traditional rock style mixed with chip really kicked off the show. Their setlist included some tracks from their collaborative Horchata album, except with just them instead of Awkward Terrible as well as it was on the album. They were followed byÂ <a title="Zen Albatross's site" href="http://zenalbatross.net/" target="_self">Zen Albatross</a>, whose tracks flowed into each other into one cohesive groove.

After him,Â <a title="virt's site" href="http://www.biglionmusic.com/" target="_blank">virt</a>Â came on stage, playing a couple tracks off his recent FX4 album and another from the Mighty Switch Force soundtrack. The crowd went wild just as he did on stage, and it was a rather crazy experience. Â Following virt was<a title="crashfaster's site" href="http://crashfaster.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">crashfaster</a>; their fusion of chip and synthesized vocals proved to be a unique and enjoyable set. Â After a short break,<a title="minusbaby's site" href="http://minusbaby.com/" target="_blank">minusbaby</a>Â took the stage. Just as with Zen&#8217;s set earlier in the night, it was one cohesive experience.

<a title="Disasterpeace's site" href="http://disasterpeace.com/" target="_blank">Disasterpeace</a>Â took the stage next, and proceeded to rock out like there was no tomorrow. He also played a mix of recent stuff and a fan favorite. We were treated toÂ <a title="Freaky DNA's site" href="http://videogameaudio.com/" target="_blank">Freaky DNA</a>Â next, and he played a mix of tracks. Dancing like mad on stage, he controlled the playlist via a usb controller and really got everyone moving.Â <a title="A_Rival's site" href="http://blog.planetskill.com/" target="_blank">A_Rival</a>Â ended the night, and a fitting finale it was. He played several tracks, including his remix of the classic Ninja Turtles theme song, and ended it with a song from his album 8-Bit Pimp. He also handed out free copies of said CD after the show.

It was a rather successful night; people had predicted upwards of 100 people to show up, and judging by how packed it was that mark was probably exceeded. Great times were had by all, some of the times drunken, but all in all a great show.
