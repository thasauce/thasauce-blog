<a target="_blank" href="http://oc.ormgas.com/">Ormgas</a> now has a total of **<u>five</u>** streams instead of the old three! The two new streams are from America and Finland, hosted by <a target="_blank" href="http://oc.ormgas.com/user.php?id.5313">member Dracoirs</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://oc.ormgas.com/user.php?id.7">admin w-ber</a> respectively. Awesome. The streams were also moved to a block on the very right side. Very streamlined now with a very nice aesthete.<a target="_blank" href="http://oc.ormgas.com/"></a>
  
That makes a total of <u>**three**</u> 80kbit
  
high quality ogg streams (125 slots from these three alone!)
  
and the original 56kbit (which is basically the same as the 80kbit) and
  
32kbit streams from <a target="_blank" href="http://oc.ormgas.com/user.php?id.1">admin ravon&#8217;s</a> home, Sweden.
