One of Ormgas&#8217;s members has started a project! This project will be massively different than the ones over at OCR. Take a look! (link at bottom)

This project works on the basis of Ormgas&#8217;s users. The users make the tracklist, decide what stays or goes (anything on the project) and work with the remixers to create what the users want.<a href="http://oc.ormgas.com/forum_viewtopic.php?2.16317" target="_blank"></a>
  
It&#8217;s a brilliant play by your fellow MagiNinjA, no? And yes, I&#8217;m a co-director I guess.

The file server will be set up as soon as I can get a php coder to do some simple crap for me ðŸ™‚

ya know&#8230;just an index that lists our songs and the tracklist&#8230;
