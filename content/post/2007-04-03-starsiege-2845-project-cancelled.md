  <em>&#8220;Let me preface this by saying this is NOT a late April fools day joke.</em></p> 
  
  <p>
    <em> After much discussion with various people on the staff, and<br /> looking at potential timelines and where we currently are, Tsa and I<br /> (being the primary legal agreement contacts with VU) have made the<br /> difficult decision that it&#8217;s time to put a bullet in this project and<br /> move on. This month (April) will mark 4 solid years of time and<br /> substantial monetary investment that he and I and a bunch of other<br /> people have into the project, and as we&#8217;re looking at at least<br /> another years worth of development with questionable outcome, we&#8217;ve<br /> decided the game has reached the point of diminishing returns and it&#8217;s<br /> time to say good night gracie.&#8221;</em><br /> </div>

      For those unaware this project even existed, Starsiege: 2845 was going to be the direct sequel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsiege" target="_blank">Starsiege</a>, the third game in an underdog mech sim series called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsiege" target="_blank">Earthsiege</a>. Most gamers will likely recognize the spinoff series &#8220;Tribes.&#8221; While the Earthsiege games are not as popular as Battletech/MechWarrior, it still has a handful of devoted followers, enough to start a grand project like 2845. The Alpha Tech Release [ATR] was released on October 18, 2006, and is available to download for free. There are a handful of maps and vehicles to pilot, including a fullly-functional flyer. The ATR was also notably of professional caliber, unlike numerous fanmade game projects found elsewhere on the Internet.</p>

        Anyone interested in playing the ATR will find the download <a href="http://browse.files.filefront.com/Starsiege+2845+Official+Demos/;1872812;/browsefiles.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It&#8217;s still just an Alpha so there will be a few bugs, but personally I didn&#8217;t have many crashes when I ran the game.</div>
