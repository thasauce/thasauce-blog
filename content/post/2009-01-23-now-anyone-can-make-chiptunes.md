  Coming Spring 2009 Sony Creative Software will be releasing a loop<br /> and sample library called, &#8220;8 Bit Weapon: A Chiptune Odyssey&#8221;. The<br /> library covers Apple II, Commodore 64 (6581r4 & 8580), NES,<br /> Gameboy, and the Atari 2600. Each system library has everything from<br /> drums, bass and synth to special effects!Both ComputeHer and I have<br /> demos built into the collection too. The sound library works with ACID,<br /> Ableton Live, Cubase, Garage Band, Logic, Soundtrack, and more! </p>
