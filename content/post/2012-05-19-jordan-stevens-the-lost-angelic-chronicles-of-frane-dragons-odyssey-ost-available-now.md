  Jordan Steven is no stranger to creating a broad range of eclectic beats that have since delighted the VGM remixing community throughout the years. As Jordan "bLiNd" Aguirre since the early '00s, you may have have heard of Steven's wonderful trance and house blends over on several OverClocked ReMix projects. However, Jordan Steven has proved that he can put down his mixing expertise momentarily and show how much he has mastered his own skills in composition with the <i>Lost Angelic Chronicles of Frane: Dragons' Odyssey</i> OST.

[Jordan Steven](http://www.jordansteven.com/)Â is no stranger to creating a broad range of eclectic beats that have since delighted the VGM remixing community throughout the years. Â Known by his active involvement as [Jordan &#8220;bLiNd&#8221; Aguirre](http://ocremix.org/artist/4440/blind) since the early &#8217;00s, you may have have heard of Steven&#8217;s wonderful trance and house blends over on several OverClocked ReMix projects as early as 2004, ranging from the earlier_Â [Kong in Concert](http://dkcproject.ocremix.org/)_ to the more recent _[Maverick RisingÂ ](http://maverick.ocremix.org/)_release this year. However, Jordan Steven has proved that he can put down his mixing expertise momentarily and show how much he has mastered his own skills in composition and musicianship.

While one may disagree to what we may state shows a pure yet comprehensive examination into his skills as an artist,Â _The Lost Angelic Chronicles of Frane: Dragons&#8217; Odyssey_ OST for the action-RPG _Dragons Odyssey Frane_ ([available now on iTunes](T&A with a Side of QQ))Â reveals that Jordan Steven more than exhibits his expert proficiency in orchestration with inspirational and deeply moving melodies like the wonderful &#8220;When The Sun Shines&#8221; or the incredibly soft &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s View (Vanneth)&#8221;.

When speaking of his experiences regarding the OST, Mr. Steven writes:

> I recently replaced the OST to the Japanese RPG &#8220;Lost Memory of Angel Story Frane 3&#8221; for the English release on the PC and iPhone/iPad.Â  It is my first game soundtrack and was a true joy to work on.Â  I also casted and directed the voice acting which was quite difficult with the limited budget and lack of experience.Â  I hope you enjoy the tunes, like me on facebook, follow me on twitter/youtube/soundcloud and let me know what you think.

A huge congratulations to Jordan Steven for creating such an excellent album. If you are as passionate as we are about great independent VGM releases, we suggest that you give thisÂ OST a try &#8212; you can preview some tracks below or listen to the full album on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lost-angelic-chronicles-frane/id516110016) or [Bandcamp](http://jordansteven.bandcamp.com/).
