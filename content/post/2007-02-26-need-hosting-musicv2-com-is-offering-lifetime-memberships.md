I just found this email sitting in the inbox of my spam address (djpoachedeggs at yahoo.com), from Chris, the founder and maintainer of MusicV2.com:

_Hello All!</p> 

I just wanted to shoot out a quick email to let
  
everyone know that we are currently running a Lifetime Membership
  
promotion in which Lifetime memberships can be purchased for only $30!
  
</em>
  

  
_Unlike previous promotions of it&#8217;s kind however, this offer is
  
available to both new and current members. If you would like to do so,
  
you can convert your current Musicv2.com
  
account to a Lifetime membership and never have to worry about making a
  
payment again. All it takes is one payment, one time and your set for
  
life!*</p> 

To take advantage of this offer, please follow the instructions below:

1.) Submit payment through the normal Musicv2.com sign-up page:

http://www.musicv2.com/register.mv2 (it is not necessary to fill out the sign-up form)

2.) After payment is made, rather than creating a new account, send an email to musicv2@musicv2.com with the following information:

Your Musicv2 Artist Name:
  

  
Your Musicv2 Artist URL:
  

  
Original Billing Email Address: (this is the email address used when you made your original payment)
  

  
First and Last Name:
  

  
New Payment ID: (this is the transaction ID you will receive after making payment)

Once payment is made and I receive the above information I will
  
cancel any active billing associated with your account, update your
  
current account to reflect your new status and send an email confirming
  
the update.

If you have any questions or need help with anything listed above, let me know.

thanks,

Chris

</em>I suggest you jump on this deal, Rama and I have been MusicV2 users since 2003, and their service has been improving exponentially over the past few years. There are even options to sell your tunes for donations, if you&#8217;re cocky enough to try that. Cheers!
