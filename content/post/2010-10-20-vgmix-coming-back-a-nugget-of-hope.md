For anyone that doesn&#8217;t know, VGMix has been down for quite some time now. Not just VGMix 2, but even the new stand-in VGMix X had disapeared from the internet entirely. virt had mentioned there was issues with the hosting, and the content management system had problems anyway (new user registration had been down for a long time as it was.)

However recently it seems there has been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vgmix.com">some activity</a>. A nugget of hope in the form of&#8230;well, virt&#8217;s puggle Nugget. Does this mean the gears are in motion once again? Could we see VGMix 3 finally sometime in theÂ foreseeableÂ future? Hopefully we&#8217;ll get more information about this sometime soon.
