Hallelujah!
  
I was able to upgrade the site&#8217;s engine, PHPNuke, to version 7.8
  
successfully, as well as update some misc files WITHOUT breaking
  
anything. The previous problems with Private Messages and the
  
semi-nonexistent Forums have disapoofed.

This means:
  
A. Rama will be happy that his site is FINALLY operational again.
  
B. I will have the satisfaction of momentary peace from Rama&#8217;s insistent nagging.
  
and C. ThaSauce is still your place of holy worship&#8230; err, your place
  
where you can get the latest on games, music, anime, or any combination
  
of the three!
  
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I meant. Really.

Over the next couple days, Rama and I plan to implement a serious of
  
updates to the site, which might even include an option for users to
  
have their own blog right here on ThaSauce!

(Screw LiveJournal, ThaSauce for teh win!)
