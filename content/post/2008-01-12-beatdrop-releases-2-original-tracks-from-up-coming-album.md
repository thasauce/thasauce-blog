<div class="quoted-text">
  Felt the need to boost this forum&#8217;s bonfire a bit, so I present to you<br /> all a couple of tracks off my forthcoming album. No guarantee that<br /> these are going to remain completely unchanged from the final versions<br /> available on the album, especially in terms of mastering, but here they<br /> are nonetheless.

  <a href="http://beatdrop.paletteswap.com/Beatdrop%20-%20Get%20Down.mp3">Get Down</a><br /> Breaks, breaks, breaks. Break-your-neck breakbeats. That&#8217;s the name of the game.</p>

    <a href="http://beatdrop.paletteswap.com/Beatdrop%20-%20Blood%20Inside.mp3">Blood Inside</a><br /> Leaning<br /> more towards what&#8217;s popular in the clubs today, this is a trip towards<br /> Electro House, but it transitions later into a ghostly piano breakdown<br /> which leads into the latter part of the song. Licensed by Positive<br /> Gaming of Sweden for use in their upcoming 32-player Dance Simulation<br /> game.</div>
