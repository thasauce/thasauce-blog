From the [MAGFest Forums](http://magfest.org/forum_message.php?forum_id=1&thread_id=427):

_&#8220;Hello, fellow gamers. We have some bad news, some good news, and a special treat. Let&#8217;s not waste any time and get this over with._
  
_**The Bad:**
  
The Minibosses have informed us that they&#8217;re taking a break from playing live shows for a little while. The downer is that MAGFest is right in the middle of their break and therefore they will not be playing. There&#8217;s still a possibility that you will see one or two of the guys at the festival (probably playing Kart DS). Additionally, we&#8217;ve removed Search Snake from the lineup, but we&#8217;re hoping they will return for a future MAGFest.</p> 

**The Good:**
  
We have two new bands taking their place! Please welcome [Armcannon](http://armcannon.com/) and [Year 200X](http://myspace.com/year200x) to the MAGFest concert lineup. They&#8217;re great guys, and we have proof they put on a rockin&#8217; show. Check out the links, go to their website to see what kind of stuff they play, learn all their names (hmm, maybe I should do that too) and such!

So you know, we&#8217;ve just now made all these changes, and we don&#8217;t quite know who&#8217;s playing which nights yet because of it. We&#8217;ll try and get the final schedule posted this week for the entire festival so you can plan accordingly.

**The Special:**
  
Remember how we try to do something cool for MAGFest attendees every year? Well, this year the first chunk of paid preregistrations will receive a supercool, special, shiny, attention-getting dogtag in addition to a regular festival badge. It&#8217;s made of METAL. And so are the bands. I think our consoles and computers are too. So now, you too can be made of METAL. Prereg as soon as you can to ensure you get one, I think we&#8217;re looking at about a dozen or so preregs remaining that will receive dogtags!

Don&#8217;t forget! **The hotel deadline is about a week away!** Get your room if you haven&#8217;t! See &#8220;Information&#8221; on the left for the link [[here](http://magfest.org/section.php?6)], or call them up and tell them you&#8217;re coming for MAGFest.&#8221;</em>
