This page is for the question blocks that my friend did at the end of
  
May. He thought that his town of Windsor, Ontario would look a lot
  
cooler if there were question blocks, circa Super Mario Brother 1,
  
around town. I&#8217;m putting this up so you can make your own question
  
blocks and put them up around your town too!
