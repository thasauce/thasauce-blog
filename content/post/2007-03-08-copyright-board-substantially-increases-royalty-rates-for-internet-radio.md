On March 2nd, the Copyright Board, under advisement from the RIAA, increased royalty rates for internet radio stations to nearly 100% of small-broadcasters&#8217; revenue. Traditionally, these rates were as low as 1-10%. Several small broadcasters have created a formal petition, complaint, and Congress-writing site at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.savenetradio.org/">http://www.savenetradio.org</a>. Just listening to Club977 80s radio right now, I&#8217;ve heard a message from their DJ asking fans to please write representatives of senators to annul this rate hike. So add your name to the petition, file a complaint with your Congressional representatives, and cast off on the Black Pearl for ye mythical pipes of bandwidth. Arrr!
