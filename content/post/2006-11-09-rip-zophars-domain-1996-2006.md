As of today, November 9, 2006, Zophar&#8217;s Domain is no longer. The site was shut down some time this morning, which is interestingly enough their 10 year anniversary (Zophar&#8217;s Domain was founded on November 9, 1996). The forums will remain up for at least the time being, but beyond that not much is known. No official reason has been given as of yet, but some staff has pointed out a lack of activity on the site in the past two years. In the meantime, Zircon and myself are working on setting up some mirrors for Zophar&#8217;s game music archive.

Rest in peace, Zophar&#8217;s Domain. You will be missed.
