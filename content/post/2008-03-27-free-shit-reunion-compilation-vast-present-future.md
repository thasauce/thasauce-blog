(NOT OVERCOAT ðŸ˜‰
  
Hey there!
  
Last wednesday was our 1Â½ birthday with <a href="http://www.reunionstudio.org" target="_blank">www.reunionstudio.org</a> and about 12 hours ago (a little late i know but we had some minor issues) we released our celebration compilation called &#8220;Vast Present & Future&#8221;

it&#8217;s a suuuuper release with 12 new tracks from our reunion
  
members, a suuuper cover made by the Art Director of a suuper record
  
label called Playground (Rasmus LindÃƒË†n).

since this is our first
  
REAL compilation i wanted it to be perfect so i&#8217;ve worked and worked on
  
the compiling for many many months now. and i&#8217;m actually quite proud of
  
the result.

check it out won&#8217;t ya?

kind regards
