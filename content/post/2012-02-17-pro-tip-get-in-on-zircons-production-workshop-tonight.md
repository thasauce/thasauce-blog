In his [most recent Facebook update](https://www.facebook.com/zirconmusic/posts/10150563552957523), award-winning sound designer and audio specialist [Andrew Aversa](http://zirconmusic.com/) has just announced that he will be hosting a _free_ production session **today, February 16th**Â Â for those who are interesting in learning the finer aspects of audio production and sound tuning:

> This FRIDAY at 9pm EST, I&#8217;m going to do an experimental 1 hour long live production session. I&#8217;ll work on a track, take some Q&A, talk tech and just generally have a good time. If it goes well I&#8217;ll probably do both freeform sessions and maybe more structured classes focused on Q&A, at a low price per &#8216;seat&#8217; (like $5-10).

Better known by his exhaustive involvement in the VGM community as[Â zircon,](http://ocremix.org/artist/4628/zircon) Aversa has arranged and collaborated on [over twenty accepted submissions and projects](http://ocremix.org/artist/4628/zircon/remixes)Â for OverClocked ReMix since 2004. He has also produced music for a variety of video games, television, and interactive media, such as _Soul Caliber V_, _Return All Robots!_, _Heroes_,Â and MTV&#8217;s _Making Of_ seriesÂ to name a few.

With zircon&#8217;s substantial experience with video game music and sound, we would like to urge aspiring professional composers and remixers or even those interested in exploring the scope of sound design to take advantage of this exciting event (can we just mention again that it&#8217;sÂ _free?)_. The production session will be hosted onÂ [Livestream](http://www.livestream.com/zirconmusic).
