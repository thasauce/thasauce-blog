[Adam WarRock](http://adamwarrock.com/), one of our [favorite](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/23/quick-look-mega-rans-pump-it-up-feat-adam-warrock/) hip hop [artists](http://thasauce.net/2012/02/25/the-vs-tour-w-mega-ran-willie-evans-jr-adam-warrock-dj-dn%C2%B3/)Â who brings back the &#8216;cool[&#8216;](http://thasauce.net/2012/04/07/adam-warrocks-ghostal-ep-out-now/) in all things nerd and pop culture, needs your help:

> I am in the process of booking a pretty baller ass Fall tour with some friends of mine. Weâ€™ve been talking with some small sponsors for the costs of the tour (so I can potentially bring some international friends with me), so if you are a small website, business, or whatever, and are interested in being promoted by our tour INTERNET PROMO MACHINE, please contact me at adamwarrockmixtape[at]gmail.com. We have very affordable rates, and you get to have access to our sweaty, rabid audiences.
> 
> Doing it like this allows us to build business relationships, as well as avoid daily tweets about kickstarters or basically begging you for money constantly. That sucks. You donâ€™t want that, right? You just want us to bring the THUNDER, donâ€™t you?!?!

WarRock has scheduled to tour various major cities on the East Coast, including New York, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and much more. While [we can attest](No track selected - iTunes [Stopped]) to WarRock&#8217;s talent as an emcee, we would like to extend his invitation to those who would be interested in sponsoring the tour through e-mail. For more information regarding press releases and to preview his music, visit Adam WarRock&#8217;s official website [here](http://www.adamwarrock.com/).
