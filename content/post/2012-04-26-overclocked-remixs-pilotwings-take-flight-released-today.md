[OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) has just released its thirty-fourth arrangement album in tribute to Nintendo&#8217;s game series Pilotwings and the original score produced by the various composers involved throughout the series such as Soyo Oka (_Pilotwings_),Â Dan Hess (_Pilotwings 64_), and Asuka Ito (_Pilotwings Resort_). The album itself features seven tracks from Indianapolis-based arrangerÂ [Drew &#8220;halc&#8221; Wheeler](http://halc.bandcamp.com/), who humbly takes his time in _Pilotwings: Take Flight_Â to combineÂ &#8220;nostalgic chiptune instrumentation with modern electronic sounds and production techniques&#8221;.

[Insert Rupee](https://www.facebook.com/insertrupee), a collaboration between [Benjamin Briggs](http://benjaminbriggs.bandcamp.com/) and halc, also make an exciting appearance, arranging two pieces from the later installments in the _Pilotwings_ series. It is also worth noting that the album&#8217;s concluding track, &#8220;Depth Perception,&#8221; is OC ReMix&#8217;s first arrangement representing the Nintendo 3DS console.

While you can download the album for free atÂ **<a href="http://flight.ocremix.org/" target="_blank">http://flight.ocremix.org</a>**, old-schoolers can also get and shareÂ _Pilotwings: Take Flight_ [byÂ torrent](http://bt.ocremix.org/torrents/Pilot...Flight.torrent) as well.
