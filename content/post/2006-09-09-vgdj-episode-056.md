This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):

N-Nani?!
  
VGDJ on Saturday? Yep, this ain&#8217;t no joke &#8211; this is our new release
  
schedule. How&#8217;s that for a nice weekend surprise? Anyway, it&#8217;s a cookie
  
feeding frenzy on Episode 056 as the OCR community&#8217;s momentum
  
continues. We&#8217;ve got new reviews, reports, a very somber Russian ReMix
  
Roulette, and the Dwelling of Duels hookup, to name just a few! Not
  
only that, but you&#8217;ll also discover the secret ingredient
  
that powers every great ReMixer, the true origins of &#8220;zircon&#8221; and
  
&#8220;pixietricks&#8221;, and what will undoubtedly be the greatest pickup line
  
you will ever hear. Download, and be merry!
  
[00:00] One must truly appreciate what is undoubtedly the greatest marketing idea of our time.  
[01:04]
  
Enter VGDJ, stage left. Wait, Saturday? Huh? If you&#8217;re reading this
  
you&#8217;ve surely noticed our schedule has changed in a way that should
  
better accomodate both you, our loyal listeners, as well as us.  
[03:15] We don&#8217;t need proxy voting to stay high on the PodcastAlley charts! Show those forum meanies that we mean business and keep on [giving us your legit votes](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140).  
[04:29] The Rama Re-oops,
  
maybe not this week. Buuuut we do have our own little announcement to
  
make. Listen in to the next episode of &#8220;The Next Level&#8221; on [GameMusicRadio](http://gamemusicradio.com/), cause we&#8217;re gonna be interviewed on there!  
[06:36] ReMix Review: [Final Doom](http://www.ocremix.org/game/finaldoom/) &#8216;[Milagro Del Demonio](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01502/)&#8216; by [TO](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/theorichalcon/)
  
&#8230; Yay for Aussies! TO seems incapable of dropping a groove that ISN&#8217;T
  
catchy, and the Doom soundtracks are really suited for his style. Like
  
his [Raptor mix](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01481/),
  
it certainly wouldn&#8217;t have hurt to have an extra instrument or two in
  
there; but even considering that small quibble, this is still Hott
  
stuff.  
[09:36] ReMix Review: [Star Ocean: The Second Story](http://www.ocremix.org/game/staroceanthesecondstory/) &#8216;[Into Your Kamikaze](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01503/)&#8216; by [blizihizake](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/blakeperdue/)
  
/ Blake Perdue &#8230; Like Darkesword, chthonic, and Tyler Heath,
  
blizihizake is one of the few mixers left using exclusively free
  
samples. Yet even with that handicap, he managed to create an
  
incredibly intricate orchestral mix with great dynamics and a great
  
arrangement. He said his goal was to prove that he could write an
  
orchestral ReMix that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;boring&#8221;. Suffice it to say, we think he
  
succeeded!  
[12:49] The Compo Report: [PRC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=90315&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), [TOMC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=87992&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), and [FLMC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=89847&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0).  
[14:32]
  
m/ m/ &#8211; That&#8217;s right. Those are &#8220;the horns&#8221;, poorly represented to
  
the best of zircon&#8217;s ability, in ASCII. And you&#8217;re gonna need &#8217;em if
  
you plan on listening to or participating in [Dwelling of Duels](http://dod.vgmix.com/).
  
DoD is a monthly ReMix competition that many OCReMixers participate in,
  
and it&#8217;s based around live instruments. If you&#8217;re just not getting your
  
daily recommended dosage of ROCK from OCR, than you gotta check DoD
  
out. Don&#8217;t take our word for it though&#8230;  
[15:41] Goemon&#8217;s Great Adventure &#8216;[Devil&#8217;s Heaven](http://dod.vgmix.com/past/jun06/01-SnappleMan-Goemon-Heaven-DoD.mp3)&#8216; by SnappleMan ([DoD June](http://dod.vgmix.com/past/jun06/) winning entry)  
[17:37] Nooooo, [GrayLightning](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/graylightning/)!
  
;_; Our beloved judge, moderator, and new age/orchestral ReMixer has
  
said goodbye to OCR and moved on to a professional, full time career in
  
music. And while no one can fill the gap that he left, it is of some
  
comfort that [zyko](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/zyko/)
  
has sorted out things in his personal life and has made return to OCR
  
and the judge&#8217;s panel. We hope that will also translate to new ReMixes,
  
now that he has some free time. With these changes, what can we expect
  
to see next? Perhaps Wingless making a triumphant return? &#8230; well,
  
maybe not&#8230;  
[19:59] The Meetup Report: [OCR Toronto](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=87688), tentative [Pittsburgh, PA](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=89972) meetup, tentative [Australia QLD](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=89996) meetup, [Video Games Live in LA](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=87719) meetup, an additional planned [Seattle](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88529) meet, and [Shael Riley NYC](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88440) concert.  
[23:37] Russian ReMix Roulette:
  
WEEK ONE of the Campaign to Keep the RRR Alive (or CKRRRA for short)
  
has begun. We will not idly sit by and watch our Roulette be
  
heartlessly dismantled piece by piece. djp, you monster! A fitting mix
  
was selected to represent our noble cause &#8211; [Final Fantasy 7](http://www.ocremix.org/game/ff7/) &#8216;[Fight On](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01253/)&#8216; by [CarboHydroM](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/carbohydrom/).  
[31:20]
  
Nothin&#8217; like a glass of water to sip while your hosts discuss the
  
merits of eating VGDJ Brand ReMixing Fuel, their ReMixer handles, Hot
  
Pockets, zircon&#8217;s incredibly smooth and obviously effective pickup
  
line, which is so powerful that it cannot be written down in any form,
  
and more. Good times.  
[38:04]
  
Will pixietricks be swayed by the irresistable charm of Kuroikaze&#8217;s
  
pickup line? Will Rama ever consistently submit a report? Why did we
  
say Cyan_Ide&#8217;s recording was good when it was actually worse than
  
usual? Find out, on the next episode of DRAGONBALL Z! Err, VGDJ. And to
  
pass the time while you&#8217;re waiting, visit our [OCR thread](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=58435), [Cafepress store](http://www.cafepress.com/vgdj), and [photo album](http://www.vgdj.net/album). Oh, and [voting for us](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140) at podcastalley.com to keep us in the top 10 of ALL podcasts wouldn&#8217;t hurt either.
