You might have heard, but OCReMixer bLiNd&#8217;s wife has started a serious shake down for her <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=20618" target="_blank">Wild ARMs ReMix project tentatively named: </a> <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=20618" target="_blank">Overture of the Vigilante Wild</a>. I had over-heard via Facebook that <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/artist/4281/amievil" target="_blank">she had manage to net AmIEvil</a>, a name I hadn&#8217;t seen mention in QUITE some time, and today while browsing the <a href="artists.php" target="_blank">Artists&#8217; Updates tab</a>, I saw they she has managed to get <a href="http://mcvaffe.com/?p=549" target="_blank">McVaffe on board as well</a>!

While most people are already excited about <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=15004" target="_blank">the upcoming DKC2 Project</a>, the Wild ARMs project is quickly ramping up to be just as exciting.

You can follow the project, as well as see the full list of tracks and artists, on <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=20618" target="_blank">the thread on the OverClocked ReMix forums</a>.
