We&#8217;ve really tried straying away from posting any [more](http://newtest.thasauce.net/2012/01/24/randoms-black-materia-remixes-scheduled-for-release-on-jan-31st/) [enthusiastic](http://thasauce.net/2011/06/26/mega-ran-releases-new-video-one-winged-angel/) [posts](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/23/quick-look-mega-rans-pump-it-up-feat-adam-warrock/) about [Mega Ran](http://megaran.com/), but this video is just too good to pass up. Even with _[Black Materia: Remixes](http://megaranmusic.com/album/black-materia-the-remixes)_ managing to stay on Bandcamp&#8217;s top seller list since its January 21st release until recently, Mega Ran still manages to rile folks up with his eclectic rap style and wonderful sense of humor. Enter Mega Ran&#8217;s freestyle ode to Jeremy Lin, which made popular headway on both YouTube with over 131,000 views and ESPN today. With smooth lyrics like &#8220;First ivy leaguer in the league since Chris Dudley /Â Must be some kinda desire / To make everybody who doubted you out to be a liar&#8221;, Mega Ran&#8217;s affirmative image of Jeremy Lin inspires us to root for the underdogs out there.

Kudos to Random for being featured on national television for such an inspirational song. If you enjoyed his rap as much as we did, [grab the song for free here](http://megaranmusic.com/track/mega-rans-jeremy-lin-rap).
