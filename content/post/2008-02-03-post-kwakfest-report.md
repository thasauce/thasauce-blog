VGMix held a kwakfest Friday night/Saturday morning in which I, and 34 other mixes from around the community participated. Other mixers include <a href="http://www.vgmix.com/Ubik" target="_blank">Ubik</a>, <a href="http://virt.vgmix.com" target="_blank">virt</a>, <a href="http://injury.thasauce.net" target="_self">injury</a>, <a href="http://www.megatwerp.com/" target="_blank">Spamtron</a>, <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/snappleman/" target="_blank">SnappleMan</a>, <a href="http://www.vgmix.com/tumult" target="_blank">tumult</a>, and many many moreeeeeeeee.

This was actually my first kwakfest, even though I&#8217;d listened in on
  
quite a few before. It was a LOT of fun and I can&#8217;t wait to join in on
  
the next one.
  
kwakfests are a 1-hour midi compo held in #kwakfest on VGMix&#8217;s IRC channel. They include a theme which&#8230;is more or less a suggestion. Afterwards everyone listens to the tracks produced together. 

<div class="quoted-text">
  A Kwakfest is, simply, a one-hour General MIDI compo. Compos are timed contests in which musicians, artists, or programmers create the best possible example of their work &#8212; from scratch &#8212; within a given time limit, under a specific set of limitations. The most common compos are hour-long tracked module competitions, where musicians use a composition tool called a tracker to write a song in 60 minutes. Surprisingly, many musicians are quite good at this, and can write several minutes worth of music with time to spare. One-hour music compos are typically referred to as OHCs, and have a long history with many notable participants. Most of the VGMix crew work primarily with MIDI sequencers as opposed to module trackers, so we&#8217;ve adapted the OHC tradition to our working method, noncompetitive spirit, and general rejection of any seriousness at all.

Last week&#8217;s theme was&#8230;well it was lookin&#8217; something like JPOP + Sports, and you can find the tracks here:
