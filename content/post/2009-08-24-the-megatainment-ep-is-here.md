<img border="0" alt="Megatainment" align="right" src="images/newsMisc/megatainment.png" />From <a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendId=18966548&#038;blogId=507031149" target="_blank">The Megas MySpace: </a>

> New music is finally here!  We just released Megatainment, a collaboration with our good friends <a href="http://www.myspace.com/entertainmentsystem" target="_blank">Entertainment System</a>!
> 
> The idea was born this time last year, when we embarked on the first Megatainment tour &#8211; basically they kept hassling us about not planning to do the MM1 soundtrack, so we said &#8220;write and record all the music and we&#8217;ll do vocals&#8230;&#8221; and that&#8217;s exactly what happened!

> We&#8217;re really excited about how this turned out &#8211; Entertainment System brings a different, heavier sound than what we play, so it was a fun challenge to come up with melodies and lyrics!  Story-wise, this fits in as a nice prequel to Get Equipped.

> Check out the Elecman track on our page, then head over to <a href="http://themegas.com/store" target="_blank">themegas.com/store</a> and pick up a copy &#8211; they&#8217;re only $5!  We&#8217;re selling hard copies for a limited time &#8211; make sure to order soon if you want to get one.
