So MAGfest has come and gone, and we&#8217;re all very sad :((( I had a really amazing time this year, and I&#8217;m sure everyone else who went will agree. I&#8217;m gonna make a PROPER MAGFest reflections post sometime later this week (or early next week, depending on how stuff works out), but for now I just wanted to post about the new and exciting stuff they&#8217;re already planning for NEXT YEAR&#8217;S MAGFest!

From <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/magfest_staff/452.html" target="_blank">the MAGFest Staff Blog</a>:

<div class="quoted-text">
  This is the new (as of Jan 2009) Magfest staff blog where we&#8217;ll be<br /> posting up news and info, and bouncing ideas off of you guys. I&#8217;m Dom,<br /> the new Music Coordinator of Magfest. Expect the same insane music from<br /> years past but more of it and even more badass.</p> 
  
  <p>
    I think I&#8217;m<br /> speaking for everyone in saying that Magfest 7 ROCKED and was the best<br /> one so far. We had 3 nights of concerts, jamspace, a chiptunes rave,<br /> tons of impromptu and scheduled bands, insane gaming, insane LAN, and<br /> all around good time. Plus we had excellent game industry presence,<br /> awesome panels. We had 1350+ attendees, almost 30% up from last year.<br /> This year we had the most game music bands ever.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am starting<br /> up this Magfest staff blog to give everyone on Magfest staff the<br /> opportunity to communicate what our plans and ideas for next year are,<br /> and to let you guys give us feedback and suggestions. Keep in mind, any<br /> of the stuff you see on this blog can change in an instant &#8211; Magfest is<br /> incredibly flexible and we&#8217;ll change stuff up until the day before if<br /> we feel like it&#8217;ll work better.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s a laundry list of our biggest things that we&#8217;re looking at for next year:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    JAMSPACE:<br /> The biggest changes relate to scheduled events in Jamspace: Next year<br /> Jamspace will return to be ONLY 24/7 unscheduled jamming. There will be<br /> no concerts of any kind in there, just freeform jamming as it was meant<br /> to be. Having scheduled events in there was a hack to get around not<br /> having the support to put them in other rooms and limiting the amount<br /> of jam times. Next year we&#8217;re going to have more space for the other<br /> events.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NEW CHIPTUNES RAVE: If you weren&#8217;t in Jamspace on Friday<br /> or Saturday night, you missed almost a dozen fantastic chiptunes<br /> artists (including the unbelievable Renard + Virt headline) rock the<br /> hell out of a packed-to-capacity, insane, glowstick-wielding,<br /> breakdancing crowd. It turns out that Magfest <em>DOES</em> like raves<br /> after all. Next year, we&#8217;re not only bringing this back, but we&#8217;re<br /> moving it into the main concert hall and doing a full-on non-stop<br /> hardcore chiptunes+dj rave &#8211; for real. Think same energy as this year<br /> but bigger and more badass. I need you all to pimp this out that next<br /> year&#8217;s rave is NOT to be missed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OPEN MIC CONCERT: One the cool<br /> side-effects of Jamspace was that it gets people together and, once in<br /> a while, spawns bands like Metroid Metal. The Open Mic concert is a<br /> chance for those going the extra step to prepare stuff to be able to<br /> show it off at Magfest. To this effect the Open mic concerts will<br /> probably be moving somewhere that&#8217;s not jamspace and getting a bit more<br /> official-ized, maybe even moving to the main concert hall during the<br /> day. They will still be open for any group that wants to sign up. We&#8217;re<br /> going to work on some details that also don&#8217;t step on bands which need<br /> practice time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STAFFING: Our staff is brilliant and hardworking,<br /> but we need more! If you&#8217;re even remotely interested in helping out,<br /> this is the year we&#8217;re going to need you the most because Magfest is<br /> going to explode. Magfest 8 is the year we&#8217;ve been waiting for. We&#8217;re<br /> looking for talented people to step up and take charge of areas they<br /> are passionate about.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    MEDIA OPS: We started up a new department<br /> at Magfest headed by Kroze and Xerol called Media Ops. Media Ops is<br /> currently gathering up over 100 hours of DV video, multitrack audio,<br /> pictures, sites, blogs, and anything for use in future promotion. This<br /> is also and archive for guys like PBC, X-Strike, ScrewAttack, and<br /> anyone else who wants stuff. The idea is that you send us a terabyte<br /> drive, or send e.g. $150 and we&#8217;ll buy one for you. We&#8217;ll load it up<br /> full of uncompressed DV video clips of interesting things with good<br /> audio, then ship the hard drive back to you for consumption.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On<br /> that note as well, I&#8217;ve started up a Wiki page for any news sites or<br /> threads or videos we find from here on out. Thanks to ANYONE who posted<br /> something about Magfest:<br /> <a href="http://baltimorebarcams.com/dom/index.php?title=Magfest7Coverage">http://baltimorebarcams.com/dom/index.php?title=Magfest7Coverage<img border="0" src="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.62/t.gif" class="snap_preview_icon" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PROMOTION:<br /> I will also say that our future promotion plans are bigger in scope<br /> than anything we&#8217;ve ever done before. I will need everyone&#8217;s help on<br /> this getting things posted to sites. Expect really really big things<br /> for next year&#8217;s marketing Blitz, which will probably kick in around<br /> August to September.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Magfest is the anti-convention and we<br /> intend to keep it that way &#8211; nothing to us is more important than<br /> keeping that grassroots user-driven feel that makes Magfest so unique<br /> amongst all other gaming and music events. HELP US ON OUR ROAD TOWARDS<br /> INEVITABLE WORLD DOMINATION.
