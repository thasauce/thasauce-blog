</center>The trailer for the 2012 Sundance Film Festival Official Selection 

[_Indie Game: The Movie_](http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/) has us going on.Â Featuring compelling stories from a myriad of top indie game designers like Â Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes (_Super Meat Boy_), Phil Fish (_FEZ)_, and Jonathan Blow (_Braid)_, the documentary itself captures the painstaking experiences of what being a independent artist truly means in a dying trade that sacrifices creativity for wealth within the twenty-first century. From passing glimpses of the film trailer, _Indie Game: The Movie_ seems to pose and answer crucial questions about the video game industry, especially with regards to the hardships and implications of Â interactive art within independent video games.

Largely funded through [various](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blinkworks/indie-game-the-movie)Â [successful](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blinkworks/indie-game-the-movie-the-final-push) Kickstarter campaigns, the film has been chiefly supported by the online community and responses have been overwhelming. First-time filmmaking duoÂ James Swirsky andÂ Lisanne Pajot have worked on this project for over a year to gather stories from indie game developers around North America in a great attempt to encapsulate what it means to &#8220;express oneself through a game&#8221;. We seem to think this attempt is quite successful, as the cinematography and film score by Canadian composer [Jim Gunthrie](http://jimguthrie.org/index.php)Â (preview his wonderful work [here](http://jimguthrie.bandcamp.com/album/sword-sworcery-lp-the-ballad-of-the-space-babies))Â we have previewed thus far proves to be incredibly breathtaking to both visual and aural senses.

While you can currently [request screenings in your city](http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/screenings/), _Indie Game: The Movie_ is [available for preorder nowÂ ](http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/shop/)on DVD and digital copy.
