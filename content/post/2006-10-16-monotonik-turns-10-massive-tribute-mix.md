  Simon says [lol]:<br />&#8220;So, we made it &#8211; &#8217;10 Years Of Monotonik &#8211; The Mix&#8217; is testament to<br /> that. It&#8217;s hard to believe that it was in early 1996 that we first<br /> started up our net.label Mono &#8211; initially as a .MOD-only label, since<br /> this was before the days of MP3s (and, indeed, of very wide use of the<br /> Internet.) What a long way we&#8217;ve come since then.

<div align="justify">
  &#8220;The first couple of years, for those who recall it, actually<br /> had individual Commodore Amiga-based BBSes distributing our material as<br /> &#8216;official distros&#8217;, before FTP sites such as Aminet kicked in and made<br /> spreading material much easier, then Scene.org started helping out and<br /> a switch to PCs and MP3s was made (in around 1999!) From then on out,<br /> there was a dalliance with sublabels, including the now defunct Mono211<br /> and Monoraveik, before Monotonik was standardized on and we carried on<br /> publishing the best Creative Commons-licensed, freely distributable<br /> MP3s we could find right to where we are now, halfway through the &#8217;00s.</p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8220;So many people deserve thanks for helping us keep on keeping<br /> on &#8211; from Tommy (Support.nl admin) through stalwart Monotonik releasers<br /> such as Vim! and Lackluster, and more recent supporters like Ossi<br /> (Planet Boelex). I&#8217;d like to thank my family and my wife Holly for<br /> giving me the inspiration to continue Mono, but most of all, it&#8217;s the<br /> Monotonik artists &#8211; you&#8217;re the label, not me, and it would be nothing<br /> without you.

    &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to estimate exactly, but millions of music tracks<br /> from hundreds of Monotonik artists have been downloaded in the last ten<br /> years, and thus, we commissioned a special mix from Christopher<br /> &#8216;Whalefish&#8217; Whaley to honor some of our favorite Mono artists and<br /> moments. Here&#8217;s the full tracklisting (and there&#8217;s some danger of a<br /> part 2 mix, since we had to leave so much good stuff out, btw):
