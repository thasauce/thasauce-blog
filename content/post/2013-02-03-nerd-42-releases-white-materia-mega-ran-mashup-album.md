[DJ Nerd42](http://olremix.org/remixers/Nerd42), who&#8217;s brought us some [great video game music mashups](http://olremix.org/remixes/899) in the past, is at it again. This time he&#8217;s mashing up songs from [Mega Ran&#8217;s _Black Materia_](http://megaranmusic.com/album/black-materia-final-fantasy-vii) with other popular rap and hip-hop tracks in what he is calling _[White Materia](http://djnerd42.blogspot.com/2013/01/white-materia-press-release.html)._

> In 2011. Mega Ran dropped â€œBlack Materiaâ€ with beats by Lost Perception and lyrics that told the epic story of Cloud Strife and his AVALANCHE allies battling the evil Shinra Inc. and Sephiroth from the classic 1997 role-playing game, â€œFinal Fantasy VII.â€ In 2012, it was followed up with, â€œBlack Materia: The Remixesâ€ with even more original awesomeness featuring many guest appearances from all over the nerdcore hip hop scene. Now, in 2013, you get to hear the same crap thatâ€™s been recycled at this point about three times, cause we just canâ€™t let it go!! Hooray! 😀

_Â White MateriaÂ _joins Nerd 42&#8217;s catalog alongside other great mashup albums including [Deltron 3742, a mashup album of the popular hip-hop album &#8220;Deltron 3030&#8221; with the Final Fantasy VII OST](http://djnerd42.blogspot.com/2011/09/deltron-3742.html). You can download or stream all of [_White Materia_ on Bandcamp](http://megaranmusic.com/album/white-materia-final-fantasy-vii-mashups).
