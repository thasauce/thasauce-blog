As some of you may already know, Sakari Infinity is holding an end of the year music competition. This competition is similar to past monthly competitions, only slightly more difficult, and promising a prize for the winner (TBA Music Software).<a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.sakari-infinity.net/forums/index.php?topic=690" target="_blank"></a>
  
Here&#8217;s the lowdown on the competition:

For this competition, musicians are given a choice between 5 themes from popular or classic video games and asked to write a substitute piece. This substitute piece must not be a remix or arrangement of the original, but an entirely new piece that could be used in place of the original. That&#8217;s where the challenge comes from&#8230;

Entries are being accepted now until Jan 1, 2007, 12:00:01 AM <span class="storytext">PST, GMT-8</p>
