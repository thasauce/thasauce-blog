So, ladies and gents, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is an issue that needs to be addressed.

As I found out from Richter a week or so ago, <a href="http://olremix.org" target="_self">OverLooked ReMiX</a>
  
has become too large for him to host any longer.  He&#8217;s pretty much
  
paying out of his own pocket too, as we aren&#8217;t a large enough site to
  
garner a consistent traffic flow, and I&#8217;m pretty sure the revenue off
  
of ads is miniscule at best.

Thus, I don&#8217;t know how much longer we&#8217;ll be around.  The only option
  
Richter and I could think of is to release songs on YouTube, and then
  
host a torrent of all of the songs for people who want individual
  
copies of them.  Richter did also move the songs to another hosting,
  
but that&#8217;s only saved them; we can&#8217;t post new remixes, and we have at
  
least one new site project to release that can&#8217;t be hosted on the
  
server.  This is why we haven&#8217;t had a new remix in about a month.

If anyone would like to lend a hand with anything (even if it comes to
  
torrenting, just having some seeds), it would be greatly appreciated. 
  
Obviously I&#8217;m not looking for someone to just take and host the site,
  
but even some alternative options than what Richter and myself have
  
thought of would help us.  Although if you would consider hosting,
  
contact Richter at richtaur at gmail dot com, and/or myself at
  
xenonodyssey at hotmail dot com.

Thanks for giving this a read.
