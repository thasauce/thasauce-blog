So OverClocked ReMix has FINALLY got around to releasing <a href="http://ff7.ocremix.org/" target="_blank">Final Fantasy VII: Voice of the Lifestream</a> (albeit too late to join the <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Celebrities/0,,2-1225-2108_2182942,00.html" target="_blank">50 Cent</a> / <a href="http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&#038;storyID=2007-09-13T175647Z_01_N12219698_RTRIDST_0_ENTERTAINMENT-HIPHOP-COL.XML" target="_blank">Kanye West</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1227692320070912" target="_blank">album war of Sept 11th</a>). Reviews have <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/news/?id=17430" target="_blank">already</a> <a href="http://www.squaresound.com/post/ocremix-releases-ffvii--voices-of-the-lifestream-fan-tribute-album.html" target="_blank">started</a> <a href="http://www.music4games.net/Review_Display.aspx?id=97" target="_blank">popping up</a> all over the place, but they&rsquo;re pretty generalized and &ldquo;ZOMG AMAZING.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m obligated to do my own review&hellip;because I have a website&hellip;and a soapbox, and you don&rsquo;t.
      
Having listened to the whole album 3 or 4 times since zircon gave me the torrent last night to seed, I think I have a pretty good feel for the whole thing by now. Ever since this album was announced I&rsquo;ve been weary of the outcome. It was a bold endeavor taking on one of the most well-known soundtracks among video game fans AND vowing to arrange MOST of it. Not to mention the hype that had been mounting up over time (especially right before it&rsquo;s release&hellip;and even after it&rsquo;s release). I wanted to hear it for myself. Screw the hype.

That being said, I can say that the album falls WELL above my expectations, but still falls short of &ldquo;knocking me off my feet&rdquo;, as some would suggest. Some of the songs I absolutely LOVE, like bLiNd and Spekko (as Steffan Andrews)&rsquo;s JENOVA themes, respectively, along with Star&rsquo;s Highwind mix (The Highwind Takes to the Skies), Terethian&rsquo;s ReMix of the Gold Saucer / Cid&rsquo;s theme (Alien Exploration), bladiator&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Golden Ivories of Gaia,&rdquo; & Darangen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Collision (Northern Crater)&rdquo;.

Some of the other songs on the album, while technically good, leave me wanting more. Zircon & Sixto&rsquo;s ReMix of Red XIII&rsquo;s theme could best be describe as &ldquo;Balls awesome technoz in a similar chord progression to the original song, 2(?) bars of the original tune repeated twice, and then more balls awesome technoz. While it SOUNDS cool and all, it&hellip;hardly feels like an arrangement of the original Red XIII theme aside from those 2 bars. Same can be said for Danny B&rsquo;s Turk&rsquo;s theme. I went around class playing a few of the songs for some of my friends, almost all of which love FF7 as much as your average fanboy, and NONE of them could identify a lot of songs. Cid&rsquo;s theme by Jovette Rivera suffers a similar problem but&hellip;well let&rsquo;s just say that song isn&rsquo;t really my favorite.

Some other things of note (& minor knit-picks) include:

&bull; If you see Sixto Sounds credited in any song, it basically means they needed a crazy guitar solo. It almost feels as if they said &ldquo;Well this song is good&hellip;but it needs more&hellip;CRAZY GUITAR SOLO&rdquo; and bam, Sixto is off. Not that this is a BAD thing, since Sixto is REALLY GOOD at what he does, just&hellip;look out for it =P. I assure you, even if you&rsquo;re doubting they could possibly fit a guitar solo into this song, it&rsquo;ll be there.
  
&bull; One-Winged Angel remix end kind of&hellip;suddenly. Like F4T4L said &ldquo;a One-Winged Angel remix that&rsquo;s less than 6 minutes is blasphemy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not at all a BAD SONG, but&hellip;geez. Give me AT LEAST another minute and a half.
  
&bull; Suzu&rsquo;s song sounds&hellip;well a lot like Suzu at first, and then Sixto totally tears it to shit.
  
&bull; <a href="http://www.tefnek.com/" target="_blank">Tefnek</a> is amazing.
  
&bull; Haroon r teh back <3333 All this being said, the best way I could some this up as a whole is this: If you&rsquo;re familiar with the artists on this album, you&rsquo;re pretty familiar with what you&rsquo;re getting here on a song basis. This isn&rsquo;t really BEYOND anything we&rsquo;ve heard from OC ReMix before, but almost all the songs on this album are better than MOST OverClocked ReMixes. It&rsquo;s HANDS DOWN the best OCR album but&hellip;it can&rsquo;t really hold a torch to stuff like the Black Mages (though better than PMM), but I mean&hellip;it is free, which is what tips the scales on this one.

Watch what happens when we give all the songs a &#8220;Various Artist&#8221; entry for the Album Artist field&#8230;</a>
