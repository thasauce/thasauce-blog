Secret Squirrel on VGMDB:
  


<div class="quoted-text">
  Its seems like it&#8217;s been forever, even though we were only down for a<br /> bit over 4 weeks. Most everyone probably knows the story by now, but on<br /> January 17th the disc that holds VGMdb (and GFF) went down and wouldn&#8217;t<br /> boot back up. We scrambled around looking for our backups, discovering<br /> that what we had together was considerably older than we remembered, so<br /> old that the only option was to attempt some kind of data recovery. Our<br /> former hosting company LayeredTech agreed to send the dead drive to us<br /> if we paid a ransom of $300 plus shipping. We had no choice, and<br /> canceled our contract with them once Miles received the drive.

  So at this, we were looking at spending a significant amount of money<br /> recovering the data. This is where OCRemix steps into the picture.<br /> Starla (Injury on OCR) works for a data recovery center. With her<br /> expertise, Miles was able to repair the drive at minimal cost, after<br /> which it booted like a champ. </p> 
  
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgfrequency.com/injury-comes-to-the-rescue-of-vgmdb-data-fully-recovered/">A more detailed synopsis with photographs of the drive repair can be found here in the VGFrequency blog.</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So we all owe a huge debt of gratitude to Starla, Liontamer, and the<br /> OCR crew, as well as to Miles for his skilled handiwork and for being<br /> the point man for the operation, and to Gigablah for getting everything<br /> up and running, even better than before.

    One thing that I can promise is that this will never happen again. The<br /> information in our database is priceless, and represents thousands of<br /> hours of work &#8212; research, translation, submission &#8212; performed by<br /> people all over the world. We hope to quickly reestablish your faith in<br /> our ability to serve as caretakers of the VGMdb data. Our new host (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.servint.net/">Servint</a>)<br /> provides us with an on-site backup, which will make it easy to recover<br /> quickly from future hardware failures. Moreover, we are going to keep<br /> at least 4 distinct backups of the database and scans, in different<br /> parts of the world, so as not to rely on any single means of recovery.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome everyone back. If you find any new<br /> issues with the site, or if something isn&#8217;t working as you expected,<br /> please let us know by posting in the forum.
