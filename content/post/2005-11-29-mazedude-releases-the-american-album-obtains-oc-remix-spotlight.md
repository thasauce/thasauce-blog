<a href="http://www.mazedude.com" target="_self">Mazedude</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.mazedude.com/aa" target="_self"><em>The American Album</em></a>
  
is an album of 15 video game music arrangements of material exclusively
  
created by American video game music composers. The album is Mazedude&#8217;s
  
first, and was conceived as an alternative to the overwhelming
  
attention given to Japanese composers by video game music fans.
  
Having been released to the public weeks before its scheduled December
  
1 release date, the album also enjoyed a spotlight at OC ReMix
  
coinciding with the posting of <span class="postbody">the Commander Keen: </span>The Armageddon Machine ReMix <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01432/" target="_self">&#8220;Slick Rippin Keen.&#8221;</a> According to Mazedude, Slick Rippin Keen &#8220;<span class="postbody">has been acclaimed as the &#8216;catchiest&#8217; track off the album,&#8221;</span> arranging Bobby Prince&#8217;s &#8220;Make It Tighter.&#8221;

The album&#8217;s website features a <a href="http://mazedude.com/aa/thefeedback.htm" target="_self">feedback area</a>
  
where, alongside fan commentary, several of the composers honored on
  
_The American Album_ have already expressed their appreciation including
  
Jack Wall, Tommy Tallarico, Jeremy Soule & Peter McConnell, as well
  
as Doom lead designer John Romero, as it continues to pick up recognition.

In light of working on_ _The American Album__ for over a
  
year and offering the finished product for free, Mazedude has solicited
  
for donations at any comfortable level from fans who enjoy the album.
