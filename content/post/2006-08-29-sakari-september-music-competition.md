  Sakari has officially started its Music Competition for<br /> September. The theme (surprise, surprise) is <strong>The Matrix</strong>. But it&#8217;s not JUST The<br /> Matrix&#8230; There is another level to choose from.
</p>

The theme this month is most definitely The Matrix, but anyone participating
  
may choose one of five pre-selected scenes from that movie to write music for.
  
The scenes for this month are:

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>1.)</strong> Chase scene with Trinity and Agent Smith at the<br /> beginning.<br /><strong><br /> 2.)</strong> Scene with Neo waiting under the bridge in the pouring-down rain.<br /><strong><br /> 3.)</strong> The &#8220;Kung Fu&#8221; scene with Neo and Morpheus.<br /><strong><br /> 4.)</strong> Scene where Agent Smith is &#8220;breaking&#8221; Morpheus in the large<br /> building.<br /><strong><br /> 5.)</strong> Scene where Neo is killed and then gains his abilities.
</p>

  Each one has a different difficulty rating and a different<br /> theme behind it. There&#8217;s already a bit of a stir in the forums about this<br /> month&#8217;s pick; word is that the musicians are excited. I think this is going to<br /> be a very fun month, and there are enough themes to pick from that no one will<br /> be able to say: &#8220;I&#8217;m no good at writing that type of music&#8221;. The<br /> Staff at Sakari are looking forward to a large number of participants this<br /> month.
</p>

  Also, the submission dates are similar to last month.<br /> Submissions for this contest will only be accepted from September 20th through<br /> September 26th. It&#8217;s a bit of a wider window this month, so it should be easier<br /> to remember to get your entry in on time.
</p>

  If you haven&#8217;t seen The Matrix, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a good<br /> reason: Maybe you were in a coma for the last 7 years, or perhaps you were in a<br /> scientific study in a strictly-confined area. But if you&#8217;re reading this, then<br /> there&#8217;s no excuse: If you&#8217;ve not seen The Matrix yet, <em>you must</em>. Not only is it<br /> a prerequisite for the contest, it&#8217;s just a plain ol&#8217; good movie that<br /> everyone should see at least once.

  As always, more information is in the Sakari forums. See you<br /> there!
