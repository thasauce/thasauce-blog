After some unexpected downtime, ThaSauce is back up. With the posting of the story about TO becoming an OverClocked Remix Judge, ThaSauce has now posted 150 news articles. Thanks to all who made it possible, and remember to keep submitting stories.   
The latest site update brings in two new content articles&#8230;
  
First off, MajiNinjA has done a <a href="modules.php?name=Content&#038;pa=showpage&#038;pid=12" target="_self">review of Audacity</a>, the first in a series of <a href="modules.php?name=Content&#038;pa=list_pages_categories&#038;cid=4" target="_self">hardware/software reviews</a>. New reviews will be added as they become available. Keep in mind that you can always submit articles as well, be it a review, a tutorial, or something else, as well as the news stories that keep the front page running. 

Secondly, Rexy has updated the <a href="modules.php?name=Content&#038;pa=list_pages_categories&#038;cid=5" target="_self">VGMix Spotlight</a> section with a review of <a href="modules.php?name=Content&#038;pa=showpage&#038;pid=13" target="_self">some of the content from this week</a>.
