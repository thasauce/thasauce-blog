From <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=78516" target="_blank">pixie&#8217;s post on OCR</a>:

<span class="postbody"><em>DrumUltimA and I have been discussing the possibility of hosting an OCR meet here in Baltimore, Maryland for a quite some time now. &#8230;Rejoice, for this dream has now become reality! Yes, it&#8217;s on April Fool&#8217;s Day, but no, it&#8217;s not a joke. ^_~ </em></span>
  
<span class="postbody"><em>When: Saturday, April 1st @ 12:00pm (i.e. noon) <br />Where: Peabody Conservatory of Music. We&#8217;ll meet outside at the </em><a href="http://img435.imageshack.us/img435/513/monument7vk.png" target="_blank"><em>Washington Monument</em></a><em>, where North Charles St. intersects with Monument St. <br />What: Lunch and dinner at any of the local restaurants of our choice, gaming at the </em><a href="http://espnzone.com/baltimore/" target="_blank"><em>ESPN Zone</em></a><em> arcade, chilling in Baltimore&#8217;s lovely </em><a href="http://www.harborplace.com/html/" target="_blank"><em>Harborplace</em></a><em>, wreaking April Fool&#8217;s havoc in our dorm, and possibly even an evening show at the </em><a href="http://www.mdsci.org/shows/imax.html" target="_blank"><em>IMAX Theater</em></a><em>! <br />Bring: Videogames, money for food, arcade (if you wish), and $8.00 for an IMAX show. </p> 

<p>
  Parking is available in the Peabody garage if you can&#8217;t find a spot on the street. If you are coming from afar, there is also the option of Amtrak, which arrives at Baltimore&#8217;s Penn Station just a 15 minute&#8217;s walk from Peabody.
</p>

<p>
  We&#8217;re gonna have fuuuuuuuuuun! ^_^
