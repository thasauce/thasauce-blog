Think you know video game music? Think again.Â Since the band&#8217;s inception in 2000, [The OneUps](http://www.theoneups.com/)Â have long been praised for their diverse approach to VGM as a specific genre. At ThaSauce, we really do appreciate and applaud those who have quite a persistent determination to push past their own boundaries of musicianship. As a musical collective that continuously changes up the VGM scene through a variety of experimental styles, we would definitely say that this band truly delivers.

The [Unofficial PAX Community DVD](http://www.paxcommunitydvd.net/) team have come together to deliver what we think is one of the best OneUps performances to date. Did you happen to miss the OneUps at this year&#8217;s [MAGFest X](http://magfest.org/)? With consistently stunning multi-angle shots and such high-quality camera work, you really do feel like you are right there in the front row. Special thanks to the Unofficial PAX Community DVD guys and the OneUps for allowing us to relive one of the best experiences of MAGFest!
