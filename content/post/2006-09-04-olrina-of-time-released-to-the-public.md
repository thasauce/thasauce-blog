<div>
  Today, OverLooked ReMix has released its latest site project <a href="http://zelda64.olremix.org/" target="_self">OLRina of Time</a>, holding 25 remixes covering various original music from the Nintendo 64 title <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>.</p>

    Xenon Odyssey, the project&#8217;s savior/head coordinator, expressed his personal thanks at OverClocked Remix earlier today.</div>

      &#8220;After a year and a month, it&#8217;s finally done.

      I&#8217;d like to give a big fuck-you to Sinewav and Monday, as the former started the project and then abandoned it, and the latter promised me a song and never came through. You guys suck.

      A big thank-you goes to shpladoink & Kupi for finally getting the final song done and winning the contest I had in place.&#8221;
