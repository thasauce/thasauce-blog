Predicted to be the â€œabsolute biggest year everâ€, the [10th annual Music and Gaming Festival](http://magfest.org/) has just been announced.Â  If you're unaware of one of the most anticipated events in VGM community, get in the know: started by Brendan Becker in 2002, MAGFest is an annual event by fans devoted to the celebration of video games and video game music for fans. Since then, attendance has increased drastically while MAGFest's theatrics get bigger and better each and every year.

An official MAGFest announcement has confirmed mind-blowing performances from [Random Encounter](http://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.aspx?epk_id=297704) and [The Megas](http://www.themegas.com/main/main.html) as well as appearances from special guests [Arin â€œEgoraptorâ€ Hanson](http://egoraptor.net/), mastermind behind the &#8220;Awesome&#8221; series of flash video game parody cartoons, and [Jon St. John](http://jsjprod.com/), the voice responsible for the badassery of the Duke Nukem we've grown to love. More guests and musicians will also be announced soon.

MAGFest X will be held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland on January 5-8, 2012. [Pre-register today](http://magfest.org/prereg) to ensure your attendance to one of the most exciting events of the year!
