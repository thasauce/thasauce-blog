So being an insomniac of sorts, I decided to poke around the internet
  
to keep myself occupied earlier this morning. I did my rounds to the
  
few sites I regularly visit in the order I expected them to be
  
interesting. The last site I checked was <a href="http://www.vgcats.com" target="_self">VGCats</a>. While there the latest news article happened too catch my eye:

_**Saturday, August
                              
6, 2005 4:26 PM &#8211; Jacko**</p> 

I&#8217;m fairly sure Jack Thompson isn&#8217;t right in the head.
                              
Forwards an email to me about Killer 7. I email him
                              
back. He threatens legal action for harrasment. Wtf?

[Read the full thing here.](http://www.vgcats.com/jack.php)

Edit: Yes I checked the headers. Same IP, it was him
                              
both times and not a spoof.</em>

So APPARENTLY Jack Thompson is forwardining his huge and elaborately
  
written exagerrations and forwarding to them to people who parody him,
  
while ADDRESSING them on a FIRST NAME BASIS, and THEN completely forget
  
(more like flat out lying) he sent it in the FIRST PLACE, but not
  
before throwing a few other lines in for good measure:

_&#8220;Get a name and a life.&#8221;_

Oh the irony in that one.

&#8220;No, you emailed me. **HOnestly, are
                                
all of you gamers on drugs, or what?**&#8220;

Gee thanks, Jack. Nice generalization =.

&#8220;dear idiot: you initially contacted
                                
me. stop, or else. got it?&#8221;

Jack Thompson&#8230;king of the insult.

Anyway VGCats is claiming that all of this IS indeed real, as stated
  
above. Really nothing would suprise me at this point, but if it IT
  
indeed real, then I think it&#8217;s QUITE clear Jack Thompson has a bit more
  
than a few screws loose. Possibly the entire chassis.
