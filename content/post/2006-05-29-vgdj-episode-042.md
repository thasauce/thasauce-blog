It&#8217;s back to business as usual here on the show, and the OCR community
  
has been mysteriously quiet&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t stop us! Live game
  
concerts (PLAY!, Video Games Live, OneUps Live) seem to be the theme of
  
the week, and though we&#8217;ve just come back from a meetup, we&#8217;re all set
  
for Otakon to further the cause of video game music. And what happens
  
when we get our 10th call about the frickin&#8217; Russian ReMix Roulette
  
Math?! Listen in to find out!
  
<span>[00:00]</span> Who said we didn&#8217;t ever play profane voicemails?!  
<span><br />[00:54] </span>\*psshh\*
  
Now boarding, VGDJ airlines&#8230; OK, just kidding. We&#8217;re all back in our
  
respective homes, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t have some fun. Oh
  
yeah, and it isn&#8217;t quite the end of the month yet, so [toss us those last few votes](http://www.podcastalley.com/one_vote2.php?pod_id=4140).  
<span><br />[02:12]</span> <span>The Rama Report</span>: [PLAY](http://myspace.com/vgmmovie) (the video game music documentary, that is) adds a clip of some [live performance footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6e5JEOAX4g) to YouTube. ..wait, that&#8217;s it? Well, a short Rama report is better than nothing!  
<span><br />[03:45] ReMix Review</span>: From [Mega Man 2](http://www.ocremix.org/game/megaman2/): &#8216;[Wily and the Deep Forest](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01477/)&#8216; by [Diggi Dis](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/diggidis/) &#8230; Continuing with his trademark groove-oriented instrumental style, Diggi Dis has created a <span>very</span>
  
tight ReMix that we enjoyed just about all the way through. The only
  
smudge on this otherwise excellent track was a sort of fakey string
  
sample at the introduction, but that was quickly forgotten as the mix
  
continued and developed. Worth mentioning; Diggi Dis is part of an
  
urban record label, [Urbanizm Music](http://www.urbanizmmusic.com/), founded by fellow ReMixer [DCT](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/dct/). So if you liked this style, consider checking out Urbanizm for more good stuff.  
<span><br />[08:23] The Compo Report</span>: [PRC68](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=83976&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), [PRC69](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=2428984%232428984), [TOMC13](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84505&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), [FLMC2](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=80879&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), and [ORC47](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=83698&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0). It just ain&#8217;t the same live! üôÅ  
<span><br />[11:21] </span>[Otakon](http://www.otakon.com/default2.asp)
  
is not all that far off, and even those of you who aren&#8217;t normally
  
anime-convention regulars may be interested in this next one. We&#8217;re
  
planning on doing a video game music/OCReMix &#8220;panel&#8221; featuring
  
djpretzel, GeoffreyTaucer, possibly sgx, and of course, us (so far).
  
We&#8217;ll be spreading the good word about the merits of dem funkay
  
ReMixes, possibly through some audio/visual stuff, live performance,
  
Q&A, who knows! It should be fun, so if you&#8217;ve ever been on the
  
fence about dropping a bit of cash to go to Otakon, this should
  
convince ya.  
<span><br />[13:27] <span>The Meetup Report</span></span>: The [Otakon meetup](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84273)
  
(Aug 4-6 in Baltimore, MD) is looking good so far with a healthy list
  
of attendees. Meanwhile, our Aussie friends have been hard at work
  
finalizing the details of the [AU meetup](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=83917) (or meetup<span>s</span>). Finally, the [Alberta meetup](http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=84330) hasn&#8217;t seen much progress made on finalized plans, but the people interested aren&#8217;t giving up yet.  
<span><br />[16:49]</span> [GeoffreyTaucer](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/geoffreytaucer/) and co. call from [Dale North](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/dalenorth/)&#8216;s house prior to the [OneUps Live](http://www.theoneupslive.com/) concert!  
<span><br />[17:53] </span>It&#8217;s a bonanza of live video game music!! <span></span>[PLAY!](http://www.play-symphony.com/)
  
&#8211; a Video Game Music Symphony just performed in Chicago but the tour
  
isn&#8217;t over by any stretch of the imagination, so check out [the website](http://www.play-symphony.com/) to see if it&#8217;s coming by your area. [Video Games Live](http://www.videogameslive.com/index.php?s=home)
  
performs next week in Philadelphia and that too will be traveling all
  
over the country in the next few months &#8211; and apparently, even a few
  
other <span>countries</span> as well! Of course, PLAY&#8217;s world tour begins even sooner. It&#8217;s a good time to be a video game music fan.  
<span><br />[19:03]</span> <span>Russian ReMix Roulette</span>:
  
This week&#8217;s lineup was a blast from the past, with five of the six
  
mixes on the roulette being at least several years old. And while we&#8217;ve
  
returned to losing consistently, perhaps when zircon tosses the die of
  
fate next week things will be different&#8230; muahahaha! Anyway, we ended
  
up with a real classic. From [Punch Out!!](http://www.ocremix.org/game/punchout%21%21/): &#8216;[Dream Fighter](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00165/)&#8216; by [Scott Peeples](http://www.ocremix.org/remixer/scottpeeples/).  
<span><br />[27:11]</span>
  
zircon is still slogging through the last few weeks of the term, but
  
he&#8217;s managed to start a third original album which is well-underway.
  
Meanwhile, pixietricks is going to be moving soon, which will leave the
  
show&#8217;s editing (temporarily, at least) in the hands of zircon &#8211; a
  
frightening thought, indeed. And&#8230; a Final Fantasy 7 ReMix Project?
  
zomg! Ya&#8217;ll stay tuned for details.  
<span><br />[30:53] </span>Thus concludes another chapter in the VGDJ saga.
