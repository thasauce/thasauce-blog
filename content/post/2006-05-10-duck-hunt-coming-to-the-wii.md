IGN Wii has learned that Nintendo is planning to showcase a Wii sequel
  
to its classic shooter series Duck Hunt at its E3 2006 booth on
  
Wednesday. The title will be playable. No other details about the
  
project have yet been revealed, but we will of course serve up a full
  
hands-on impressions when the time is right.
  
Duck Hunt arms players with a virtual shotgun and lets them blast away
  
at a series of flying ducks. Given the precision aiming needed in the
  
classic title, which worked with a light gun, it is all but certain
  
that the Wii-mote will act as the weapon this time around.

Stay tuned for more from the show floor on Wednesday.
