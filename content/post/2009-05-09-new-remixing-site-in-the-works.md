Out of the shadows comes [quintin3265](http://www.ocremix.org/forums/member.php?u=29068) with a post on <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?p=544438#544438" target="_blank">OverClocked ReMix</a>:

<div class="quoted-text">
  Hi,</p> 
  
  <p>
    Even though I&#8217;ve been following the remixing community for close to<br /> fifteen years, believe it or not, this is my first post here. I&#8217;d like<br /> to call people&#8217;s attention to remixSite, a new video game music site<br /> I&#8217;ve designed with the significant help of several others.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I started out trying to learn symfony and JQuery, then attended some<br /> video game music concerts, and somehow ended up with an entire website<br /> for originals and arrangements of game music. </div> 
    
    <div class="quoted-text">
      The site allows users to post either final versions of songs or works<br /> in progress, which are indicated by a separate flag. Songs can be rated<br /> and reviewed, and artists can post updates to songs (for example, a<br /> better quality sample or a remade passage). You can associate your<br /> songs to original tracks and search to find if others have remixed<br /> those tracks.</p> 
      
      <p>
        Take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://test.remixsite.org/">http://test.remixsite.org</a><br /> and see for yourself. The site needs further testing and I wouldn&#8217;t<br /> consider it worthy of production use until people have messed around<br /> with it a bit more. Feel free to upload some songs and post comments.<br /> There is a bug tracking system set up and feature requests are welcome.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        remixSite is not designed to compete with Overclocked Remix, as it has<br /> a different structure and has no judging criteria. In fact, if people<br /> are interested in remixSite, I would prefer to work with community<br /> members to integrate it with the various music sites, instead of, for<br /> example, creating yet another forum.

        Comments welcome!

      In a short conversation in #ocremix everyone had a lot of different opions. Some people questioned the need for yet another site, while others embraced the idea of a functional idea solution to what <a href="http://vgmix.com" target="_blank">VGMix</a> has been trying to do for about 3 years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I agree the site does a much better job filling the VGMix-esque niche and has a pretty different mission than that of <a href="http://ocremix.org" target="_self">OverClocked ReMix </a>or <a href="http://remix.thasauce.net" target="_blank">ReMix:ThaSauce</a>. Right now it has some fancy AJAX modules and some nifty effects (with problems of their own); the VGMdb integration is particularly nice, however I feel it&#8217;s just not far enough into the project to form any real opinions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And finally: I think it&#8217;s particularly important to note that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c">this site promotes synergy (like a boss)</a>.
