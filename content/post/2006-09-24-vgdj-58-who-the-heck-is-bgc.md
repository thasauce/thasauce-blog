This week on the show all about the music and community of [OverClocked ReMix](http://www.ocremix.org/):

It&#8217;s an adventure in adjudication with judges and zircon and
  
pixietricks! OMG it&#8217;s true, our very own pixie is now one of the few,
  
the proud, the OCR judges &#8211; along with big giant circles, who we
  
managed to grab for a candid interview about week 1 of being a
  
shtyjudgfgt. But we haven&#8217;t forgotten our roots, no sir-ee! We&#8217;re in
  
full gear with three brand spankin&#8217; new ReMix Reviews, including a clip
  
from mastah guitarist Sixto. Plus, the OCR compo scene has seen a bit
  
of a shocker for the first time in months, and even DrumUltimA brings
  
us some surprises in his meetup report. There&#8217;s even more, but it is up
  
to you to acquire Episode 058 and unlock the mystery yourself. Huzzah!
