> If the only thing that comes to your mind when someone says the word â€œPowergloveâ€ is a failed Nintendo peripheral, it's time to start thinking differently. Powerglove is also a metal band that chugs out blisteringly brutal renditions of your favorite video game tunes. From Sonic to Final Fantasy IV, from 8-bit to MIDI, no catchy gaming song is left un-metalized.

> During the middle of the band's current two-month tour, I had the pleasure of meeting them for a nice chat over some cheeseburgers. I spoke with Chris Marchiel (guitar), Nick Avila (bass), and Bassil Silver (drums) about their favorite games, the band's history, fan's most requested songs, and why they think metal and video game music blend together so well. (Unfortunately, Powerglove's additional guitarist, Alex Berkson, was unable to make it.)
