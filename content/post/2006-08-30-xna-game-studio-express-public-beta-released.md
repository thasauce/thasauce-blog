<span class="font">Microsoft today released the public beta of XNA<br /> Game Studio Express, the pioneering technology designed to open up game<br /> development to new audiences, including hobbyists, students and<br /> independent developers, in the hopes of injecting a shot of creativity<br /> into the electronic entertainment industry.</p> 

<p>
  Novice game creators can download the tool today from <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xna">http://msdn.microsoft.com/xna</a><br /> to develop games for Windows XP and Windows Vista, at no charge. The<br /> games built on Windows can be migrated to the Xbox 360 console system<br /> starting this holiday season as part of the XNA Creators Club<br /> subscription for $99 a year, or a four-month trial cost of $49, opening<br /> up retail console game development to anyone for the first time.</span><br /> <span class="font">Since the announcement of XNA Game Studio<br /> Express&#8217; upcoming availability on August 14, the public response has<br /> been overwhelming &#8211; more than 100 schools have requested information on<br /> how they can incorporate XNA Game Studio Express into their curricula<br /> and the breakthrough news has generated millions of hits on Internet<br /> search engines.</p> 
  
  <p>
    As one of nearly 20 leading universities<br /> worldwide incorporating XNA Game Studio Express into their curricula,<br /> including Southern Methodist University&#8217;s Guildhall and the University<br /> of Southern California&#8217;s GamePipe, Microsoft announced additional<br /> support from DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, Washington, a<br /> leader in the field of digital interactive entertainment education.<br /> Through its ProjectFUN software running on XNA Game Studio Express and<br /> summer workshops starting in 2007, DigiPen will bring Xbox 360 console<br /> game development for the first time ever to thousands of children ages<br /> 10 through 16.
