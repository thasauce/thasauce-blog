zircon from the <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/forums/showthread.php?t=9279" target="_blank">thread on OCR</a>:

You heard it, folks. Our very own Beatdrop will be on the next DDR title from Konami, with his song &#8220;Until Forever&#8221;. He did this through a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.broadjam.com/">Broadjam</a> contest and snagged $1,000 in the process&#8230; as well as some extra attention from Konami for future work, I&#8217;m sure!!!

Anyway, CONGRATULATIONS
  
and major props to him and y&#8217;all DDR players can look forward to hearing some goodness from our favorite industrial remixer/former judge. Movin&#8217; on up! ðŸ™‚
