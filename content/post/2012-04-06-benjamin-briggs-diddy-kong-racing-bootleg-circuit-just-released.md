Remember when chasing intergalactic pig wizards was the right thing to do? Or how about collecting those elusive amulet fragments? Don&#8217;t mind us over here, just fondly reminiscing aboutÂ _Diddy Kong Racing._

[Benjamin Briggs](https://www.facebook.com/bbriggsmusic/)Â has us at &#8216;hello&#8217; with keen memories of _DKR_. While we&#8217;ve gone [on](http://thasauce.net/2011/08/19/triple-review-benjamin-briggs-protodome-and-willrock/) and [on](http://thasauce.net/2012/01/31/benjamin-briggs-snake-man-vs-the-world-ep-just-released/)Â about his expressive talents as an upcoming artist within the VGM scene,Â Briggs&#8217; _Diddy Kong Racing: Bootleg Circuit_ has finally inspired the creative juices in us once more to gush about his latest endeavor with smooth house and disco influences.Â Even as his first-ever sampled game audio album, Briggs really takes the time to both highlight and complement Dave Wise&#8217;s original Â arrangements that most gamers have come to know and love about one of the fastest-selling racing games within video game history. For example, &#8220;Hi There! (Lobby)&#8221; evokes sentimentality of Wise&#8217;s thumping cadences but efficaciously transitions into what we&#8217;d call a classic &#8220;Briggs-esque&#8221; twist, leaving the listener with toes tapping and heads bobbing when noone is looking&#8230; or when they are. Who are we kidding? &#8220;Hot Pockets (Hot Top Volcano)&#8221;, another favorite, encourages a major chill-out mood with entrancing rhythms while bringing about nostalgic yet gut-wrenching feelings for that damn volcano stage.

Did we mention that all the tracks have been mastered by [Dj CUTMAN](http://www.djcutman.com/)? Released exclusively from Dj CUTMAN&#8217;s new music label [Gamechops](http://www.gamechops.com/), Brigg&#8217;s newest EPÂ gives us an exciting preview of what we should expect from this group of artists who are driven by the simple passion of creating music.Â _Diddy Kong Racing: Bootleg Circuit_ is available on [Bandcamp](http://benjaminbriggs.bandcamp.com/releases) now, which you have no reason NOT to download because it&#8217;s free!
