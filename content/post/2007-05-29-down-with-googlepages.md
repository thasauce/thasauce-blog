Hear this: If you submit a song to R:TS that is hosted on Googlepages you will IMMEDIATELY be blackballed for no less than 5 years with no exceptions. I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re Yasunori Mitsuda, I&#8217;m not going to try 15 times to get your song downloaded entirely.
  
Ok, so that&#8217;s a bit of an exagerration, but the 15 times is NOT. Seriously if you need hosting, ASK US. We have more than enough space and bandwidth, seriously. In the meantime JUST ATTACH THE SONG TO YOUR E-MAIL. IT&#8217;S COOL I PROMISE.
