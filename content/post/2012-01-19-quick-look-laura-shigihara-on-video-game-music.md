</center>Here at ThaSauce, we loveÂ 

[Laura Shigihara](http://shigi.wordpress.com/)&#8216;s [music](http://thasauce.net/2011/07/01/plants-vs-zombies-medley-recreated-with-four-gu-zheng-rad-video/). No seriously, we absolutely adore her. Apart from being [quite the busy lady](http://thasauce.net/?p=2134) nowadays, thisÂ acclaimed Plants vs. Zombies composer takes time out of her involved schedule to post intriguing personal vlogs on [her YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/shigiteatime), like bathing an elephant (what?!) and raving about her love for tea. This time around, Laura Shigihara comes up with a couple of reasons why she loves video game music. Highlights of this video include Ms. Shigihara&#8217;s Â inspirations for choosing to create video game music as a career and her experiences with early varying genres of music within video games.

Coupled with the fact that Laura Shigihara&#8217;s voice is as endearing as a dozen fluffy kittens,Â this video is quite inspirational for aspiring professional VGM composers everywhere.
